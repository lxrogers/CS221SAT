Project Gutenberg Etext, The Lost Continent by Edgar Rice Burroughs
********This file should be named lcont10.txt or lcont10.zip*******

Corrected EDITIONS of our etexts get a new NUMBER, lcont11.txt.
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, lcont10a.txt.

This etext was created by Judith Boss, Omaha, Nebraska.
The equipment:  an IBM-compatible 486/50, a Hewlett-Packard
ScanJet IIc flatbed scanner, and a copy of Calera Recognition
Systems' M/600 Series Professional OCR software and RISC
accelerator board donated by Calera.


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates, for time for better editing.  We
have this as a goal to accomplish by the end of the year but we
cannot guarantee to stay that far ahead every month after that.

Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $4
million dollars per hour this year as we release some eight text
files per month:  thus upping our productivity from $2 million.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is 10% of the expected number of computer users by the end
of the year 2001.

THE LOST CONTINENT

Edgar Rice Burroughs



1


Since earliest childhood I have been strangely fascinated by
the mystery surrounding the history of the last days of
twentieth century Europe.  My interest is keenest, perhaps,
not so much in relation to known facts as to speculation
upon the unknowable of the two centuries that have rolled by
since human intercourse between the Western and Eastern
Hemispheres ceased--the mystery of Europe's state following
the termination of the Great War--provided, of course, that
the war had been terminated.

From out of the meagerness of our censored histories we
learned that for fifteen years after the cessation of
diplomatic relations between the United States of North
America and the belligerent nations of the Old World, news
of more or less doubtful authenticity filtered, from time to
time, into the Western Hemisphere from the Eastern.

Then came the fruition of that historic propaganda which is
best described by its own slogan: "The East for the East--
the West for the West," and all further intercourse was
stopped by statute.

Even prior to this, transoceanic commerce had practically
ceased, owing to the perils and hazards of the mine-strewn
waters of both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.  Just when
submarine activities ended we do not know but the last
vessel of this type sighted by a Pan-American merchantman
was the huge Q 138, which discharged twenty-nine torpedoes
at a Brazilian tank steamer off the Bermudas in the fall of
1972.  A heavy sea and the excellent seamanship of the
master of the Brazilian permitted the Pan-American to escape
and report this last of a long series of outrages upon our
commerce.  God alone knows how many hundreds of our ancient
ships fell prey to the roving steel sharks of blood-frenzied
Europe.  Countless were the vessels and men that passed over
our eastern and western horizons never to return; but
whether they met their fates before the belching tubes of
submarines or among the aimlessly drifting mine fields, no
man lived to tell.

And then came the great Pan-American Federation which linked
the Western Hemisphere from pole to pole under a single
flag, which joined the navies of the New World into the
mightiest fighting force that ever sailed the seven seas--
the greatest argument for peace the world had ever known.

Since that day peace had reigned from the western shores of
the Azores to the western shores of the Hawaiian Islands,
nor has any man of either hemisphere dared cross 30dW. or
175dW.  From 30d to 175d is ours--from 30d to 175d is
peace, prosperity and happiness.

Beyond was the great unknown.  Even the geographies of my
boyhood showed nothing beyond.  We were taught of nothing
beyond.  Speculation was discouraged.  For two hundred years
the Eastern Hemisphere had been wiped from the maps and
histories of Pan-America.  Its mention in fiction, even, was
forbidden.

Our ships of peace patrol thirty and one hundred seventy-
five.  What ships from beyond they have warned only the
secret archives of government show; but, a naval officer
myself, I have gathered from the traditions of the service
that it has been fully two hundred years since smoke or sail
has been sighted east of 30d or west of 175d.  The fate of
the relinquished provinces which lay beyond the dead lines
we could only speculate upon.  That they were taken by the
military power, which rose so suddenly in China after the
fall of the republic, and which wrested Manchuria and Korea
from Russia and Japan, and also absorbed the Philippines, is
quite within the range of possibility.

It was the commander of a Chinese man-of-war who received a
copy of the edict of 1972 from the hand of my illustrious
ancestor, Admiral Turck, on one hundred seventy-five, two
hundred and six years ago, and from the yellowed pages of
the admiral's diary I learned that the fate of the
Philippines was even then presaged by these Chinese naval
officers.

Yes, for over two hundred years no man crossed 30d to 175d
and lived to tell his story--not until chance drew me across
and back again, and public opinion, revolting at last
against the drastic regulations of our long-dead forbears,
demanded that my story be given to the world, and that the
narrow interdict which commanded peace, prosperity, and
happiness to halt at 30d and 175d be removed forever.

I am glad that it was given to me to be an instrument in the
hands of Providence for the uplifting of benighted Europe,
and the amelioration of the suffering, degradation, and
abysmal ignorance in which I found her.

I shall not live to see the complete regeneration of the
savage hordes of the Eastern Hemisphere--that is a work
which will require many generations, perhaps ages, so
complete has been their reversion to savagery; but I know
that the work has been started, and I am proud of the share
in it which my generous countrymen have placed in my hands.

The government already possesses a complete official report
of my adventures beyond thirty.  In the narrative I purpose
telling my story in a less formal, and I hope, a more
entertaining, style; though, being only a naval officer and
without claim to the slightest literary ability, I shall
most certainly fall far short of the possibilities which are
inherent in my subject.  That I have passed through the most
wondrous adventures that have befallen a civilized man
during the past two centuries encourages me in the belief
that, however ill the telling, the facts themselves will
command your interest to the final page.

Beyond thirty!  Romance, adventure, strange peoples,
fearsome beasts--all the excitement and scurry of the lives
of the twentieth century ancients that have been denied us
in these dull days of peace and prosaic prosperity--all, all
lay beyond thirty, the invisible barrier between the stupid,
commercial present and the carefree, barbarous past.

What boy has not sighed for the good old days of wars,
revolutions, and riots; how I used to pore over the
chronicles of those old days, those dear old days, when
workmen went armed to their labors; when they fell upon one
another with gun and bomb and dagger, and the streets ran
red with blood!  Ah, but those were the times when life was
worth the living; when a man who went out by night knew not
at which dark corner a "footpad" might leap upon and slay
him; when wild beasts roamed the forest and the jungles, and
there were savage men, and countries yet unexplored.

Now, in all the Western Hemisphere dwells no man who may not
find a school house within walking distance of his home, or
at least within flying distance.

The wildest beast that roams our waste places lairs in the
frozen north or the frozen south within a government
reserve, where the curious may view him and feed him bread
crusts from the hand with perfect impunity.

But beyond thirty!  And I have gone there, and come back;
and now you may go there, for no longer is it high treason,
punishable by disgrace or death, to cross 30d or 175d.

My name is Jefferson Turck.  I am a lieutenant in the navy--
in the great Pan-American navy, the only navy which now
exists in all the world.

I was born in Arizona, in the United States of North
America, in the year of our Lord 2116.  Therefore, I am
twenty-one years old.

In early boyhood I tired of the teeming cities and
overcrowded rural districts of Arizona.  Every generation of
Turcks for over two centuries has been represented in the
navy.  The navy called to me, as did the free, wide,
unpeopled spaces of the mighty oceans.  And so I joined the
navy, coming up from the ranks, as we all must, learning our
craft as we advance.  My promotion was rapid, for my family
seems to inherit naval lore.  We are born officers, and I
reserve to myself no special credit for an early advancement
in the service.

At twenty I found myself a lieutenant in command of the
aero-submarine Coldwater, of the SS-96 class.  The Coldwater
was one of the first of the air and underwater craft which
have been so greatly improved since its launching, and was
possessed of innumerable weaknesses which, fortunately, have
been eliminated in more recent vessels of similar type.

Even when I took command, she was fit only for the junk
pile; but the world-old parsimony of government retained her
in active service, and sent two hundred men to sea in her,
with myself, a mere boy, in command of her, to patrol thirty
from Iceland to the Azores.

Much of my service had been spent aboard the great
merchantmen-of-war.  These are the utility naval vessels
that have transformed the navies of old, which burdened the
peoples with taxes for their support, into the present day
fleets of self-supporting ships that find ample time for
target practice and gun drill while they bear freight and
the mails from the continents to the far-scattered island of
Pan-America.

This change in service was most welcome to me, especially as
it brought with it coveted responsibilities of sole command,
and I was prone to overlook the deficiencies of the
Coldwater in the natural pride I felt in my first ship.

The Coldwater was fully equipped for two months' patrolling--
the ordinary length of assignment to this service--and a
month had already passed, its monotony entirely unrelieved
by sight of another craft, when the first of our misfortunes
befell.

We had been riding out a storm at an altitude of about three
thousand feet.  All night we had hovered above the tossing
billows of the moonlight clouds.  The detonation of the
thunder and the glare of lightning through an occasional
rift in the vaporous wall proclaimed the continued fury of
the tempest upon the surface of the sea; but we, far above
it all, rode in comparative ease upon the upper gale.  With
the coming of dawn the clouds beneath us became a glorious
sea of gold and silver, soft and beautiful; but they could
not deceive us as to the blackness and the terrors of the
storm-lashed ocean which they hid.

I was at breakfast when my chief engineer entered and
saluted.  His face was grave, and I thought he was even a
trifle paler than usual.

"Well?" I asked.

He drew the back of his forefinger nervously across his brow
in a gesture that was habitual with him in moments of mental
stress.

"The gravitation-screen generators, sir," he said.  "Number
one went to the bad about an hour and a half ago.  We have
been working upon it steadily since; but I have to report,
sir, that it is beyond repair."

"Number two will keep us supplied," I answered.  "In the
meantime we will send a wireless for relief."

"But that is the trouble, sir," he went on.  "Number two has
stopped.  I knew it would come, sir.  I made a report on
these generators three years ago.  I advised then that they
both be scrapped.  Their principle is entirely wrong.
They're done for."  And, with a grim smile, "I shall at
least have the satisfaction of knowing my report was
accurate."

"Have we sufficient reserve screen to permit us to make
land, or, at least, meet our relief halfway?" I asked.

"No, sir," he replied gravely; "we are sinking now."

"Have you anything further to report?" I asked.

"No, sir," he said.

"Very good," I replied; and, as I dismissed him, I rang for
my wireless operator.  When he appeared, I gave him a
message to the secretary of the navy, to whom all vessels in
service on thirty and one hundred seventy-five report
direct.  I explained our predicament, and stated that with
what screening force remained I should continue in the air,
making as rapid headway toward St. Johns as possible, and
that when we were forced to take to the water I should
continue in the same direction.

The accident occurred directly over 30d and about 52d N.
The surface wind was blowing a tempest from the west.  To
attempt to ride out such a storm upon the surface seemed
suicidal, for the Coldwater was not designed for surface
navigation except under fair weather conditions.  Submerged,
or in the air, she was tractable enough in any sort of
weather when under control; but without her screen
generators she was almost helpless, since she could not fly,
and, if submerged, could not rise to the surface.

All these defects have been remedied in later models; but
the knowledge did not help us any that day aboard the slowly
settling Coldwater, with an angry sea roaring beneath, a
tempest raging out of the west, and 30d only a few knots
astern.

To cross thirty or one hundred seventy-five has been, as you
know, the direst calamity that could befall a naval
commander.  Court-martial and degradation follow swiftly,
unless as is often the case, the unfortunate man takes his
own life before this unjust and heartless regulation can
hold him up to public scorn.

There has been in the past no excuse, no circumstance, that
could palliate the offense.

"He was in command, and he took his ship across thirty!"
That was sufficient.  It might not have been in any way his
fault, as, in the case of the Coldwater, it could not
possibly have been justly charged to my account that the
gravitation-screen generators were worthless; but well I
knew that should chance have it that we were blown across
thirty today--as we might easily be before the terrific west
wind that we could hear howling below us, the responsibility
would fall upon my shoulders.

In a way, the regulation was a good one, for it certainly
accomplished that for which it was intended.  We all fought
shy of 30d on the east and 175d on the west, and, though we
had to skirt them pretty close, nothing but an act of God
ever drew one of us across.  You all are familiar with the
naval tradition that a good officer could sense proximity to
either line, and for my part, I am firmly convinced of the
truth of this as I am that the compass finds the north
without recourse to tedious processes of reasoning.

Old Admiral Sanchez was wont to maintain that he could smell
thirty, and the men of the first ship in which I sailed
claimed that Coburn, the navigating officer, knew by name
every wave along thirty from 60dN. to 60dS.  However, I'd
hate to vouch for this.

Well, to get back to my narrative; we kept on dropping
slowly toward the surface the while we bucked the west wind,
clawing away from thirty as fast as we could.  I was on the
bridge, and as we dropped from the brilliant sunlight into
the dense vapor of clouds and on down through them to the
wild, dark storm strata beneath, it seemed that my spirits
dropped with the falling ship, and the buoyancy of hope ran
low in sympathy.

The waves were running to tremendous heights, and the
Coldwater was not designed to meet such waves head on.  Her
elements were the blue ether, far above the raging storm, or
the greater depths of ocean, which no storm could ruffle.

As I stood speculating upon our chances once we settled into
the frightful Maelstrom beneath us and at the same time
mentally computing the hours which must elapse before aid
could reach us, the wireless operator clambered up the
ladder to the bridge, and, disheveled and breathless, stood
before me at salute.  It needed but a glance at him to
assure me that something was amiss.

"What now?" I asked.

"The wireless, sir!" he cried.  "My God, sir, I cannot
send."

"But the emergency outfit?" I asked.

"I have tried everything, sir.  I have exhausted every
resource.  We cannot send," and he drew himself up and
saluted again.

I dismissed him with a few kind words, for I knew that it
was through no fault of his that the mechanism was
antiquated and worthless, in common with the balance of the
Coldwater's equipment.  There was no finer operator in Pan-
America than he.

The failure of the wireless did not appear as momentous to
me as to him, which is not unnatural, since it is but human
to feel that when our own little cog slips, the entire
universe must necessarily be put out of gear.  I knew that
if this storm were destined to blow us across thirty, or
send us to the bottom of the ocean, no help could reach us
in time to prevent it.  I had ordered the message sent
solely because regulations required it, and not with any
particular hope that we could benefit by it in our present
extremity.

I had little time to dwell upon the coincidence of the
simultaneous failure of the wireless and the buoyancy
generators, since very shortly after the Coldwater had
dropped so low over the waters that all my attention was
necessarily centered upon the delicate business of settling
upon the waves without breaking my ship's back.  With our
buoyancy generators in commission it would have been a
simple thing to enter the water, since then it would have
been but a trifling matter of a forty-five degree dive into
the base of a huge wave.  We should have cut into the water
like a hot knife through butter, and have been totally
submerged with scarce a jar--I have done it a thousand
times--but I did not dare submerge the Coldwater for fear
that it would remain submerged to the end of time--a
condition far from conducive to the longevity of commander
or crew.

Most of my officers were older men than I.  John Alvarez, my
first officer, is twenty years my senior.  He stood at my
side on the bridge as the ship glided closer and closer to
those stupendous waves.  He watched my every move, but he
was by far too fine an officer and gentleman to embarrass me
by either comment or suggestion.

When I saw that we soon would touch, I ordered the ship
brought around broadside to the wind, and there we hovered a
moment until a huge wave reached up and seized us upon its
crest, and then I gave the order that suddenly reversed the
screening force, and let us into the ocean.  Down into the
trough we went, wallowing like the carcass of a dead whale,
and then began the fight, with rudder and propellers, to
force the Coldwater back into the teeth of the gale and
drive her on and on, farther and farther from relentless
thirty.

I think that we should have succeeded, even though the ship
was wracked from stem to stern by the terrific buffetings
she received, and though she were half submerged the greater
part of the time, had no further accident befallen us.

We were making headway, though slowly, and it began to look
as though we were going to pull through.  Alvarez never left
my side, though I all but ordered him below for much-needed
rest.  My second officer, Porfirio Johnson, was also often
on the bridge.  He was a good officer, but a man for whom I
had conceived a rather unreasoning aversion almost at the
first moment of meeting him, an aversion which was not
lessened by the knowledge which I subsequently gained that
he looked upon my rapid promotion with jealousy.  He was ten
years my senior both in years and service, and I rather
think he could never forget the fact that he had been an
officer when I was a green apprentice.

As it became more and more apparent that the Coldwater,
under my seamanship, was weathering the tempest and giving
promise of pulling through safely, I could have sworn that I
perceived a shade of annoyance and disappointment growing
upon his dark countenance.  He left the bridge finally and
went below.  I do not know that he is directly responsible
for what followed so shortly after; but I have always had my
suspicions, and Alvarez is even more prone to place the
blame upon him than I.

It was about six bells of the forenoon watch that Johnson
returned to the bridge after an absence of some thirty
minutes.  He seemed nervous and ill at ease--a fact which
made little impression on me at the time, but which both
Alvarez and I recalled subsequently.

Not three minutes after his reappearance at my side the
Coldwater suddenly commenced to lose headway.  I seized the
telephone at my elbow, pressing upon the button which would
call the chief engineer to the instrument in the bowels of
the ship, only to find him already at the receiver
attempting to reach me.

"Numbers one, two, and five engines have broken down, sir,"
he called.  "Shall we force the remaining three?"

"We can do nothing else," I bellowed into the transmitter.

"They won't stand the gaff, sir," he returned.

"Can you suggest a better plan?" I asked.

"No, sir," he replied.

"Then give them the gaff, lieutenant," I shouted back, and
hung up the receiver.

For twenty minutes the Coldwater bucked the great seas with
her three engines.  I doubt if she advanced a foot; but it
was enough to keep her nose in the wind, and, at least, we
were not drifting toward thirty.

Johnson and Alvarez were at my side when, without warning,
the bow swung swiftly around and the ship fell into the
trough of the sea.

"The other three have gone," I said, and I happened to be
looking at Johnson as I spoke.  Was it the shadow of a
satisfied smile that crossed his thin lips?  I do not know;
but at least he did not weep.

"You always have been curious, sir, about the great unknown
beyond thirty," he said.  "You are in a good way to have
your curiosity satisfied."  And then I could not mistake the
slight sneer that curved his upper lip.  There must have
been a trace of disrespect in his tone or manner which
escaped me, for Alvarez turned upon him like a flash.

"When Lieutenant Turck crosses thirty," he said, "we shall
all cross with him, and God help the officer or the man who
reproaches him!"

"I shall not be a party to high treason," snapped Johnson.
"The regulations are explicit, and if the Coldwater crosses
thirty it devolves upon you to place Lieutenant Turck under
arrest and immediately exert every endeavor to bring the
ship back into Pan-American waters."

"I shall not know," replied Alvarez, "that the Coldwater
passes thirty; nor shall any other man aboard know it," and,
with his words, he drew a revolver from his pocket, and
before either I or Johnson could prevent it had put a bullet
into every instrument upon the bridge, ruining them beyond
repair.

And then he saluted me, and strode from the bridge, a martyr
to loyalty and friendship, for, though no man might know
that Lieutenant Jefferson Turck had taken his ship across
thirty, every man aboard would know that the first officer
had committed a crime that was punishable by both
degradation and death.  Johnson turned and eyed me narrowly.

"Shall I place him under arrest?" he asked.

"You shall not," I replied.  "Nor shall anyone else."

"You become a party to his crime!" he cried angrily.

"You may go below, Mr. Johnson," I said, "and attend to the
work of unpacking the extra instruments and having them
properly set upon the bridge."

He saluted, and left me, and for some time I stood, gazing
out upon the angry waters, my mind filled with unhappy
reflections upon the unjust fate that had overtaken me, and
the sorrow and disgrace that I had unwittingly brought down
upon my house.

I rejoiced that I should leave neither wife nor child to
bear the burden of my shame throughout their lives.

As I thought upon my misfortune, I considered more clearly
than ever before the unrighteousness of the regulation which
was to prove my doom, and in the natural revolt against its
injustice my anger rose, and there mounted within me a
feeling which I imagine must have paralleled that spirit
that once was prevalent among the ancients called anarchy.

For the first time in my life I found my sentiments arraying
themselves against custom, tradition, and even government.
The wave of rebellion swept over me in an instant, beginning
with an heretical doubt as to the sanctity of the
established order of things--that fetish which has ruled
Pan-Americans for two centuries, and which is based upon a
blind faith in the infallibility of the prescience of the
long-dead framers of the articles of Pan-American
federation--and ending in an adamantine determination to
defend my honor and my life to the last ditch against the
blind and senseless regulation which assumed the synonymity
of misfortune and treason.

I would replace the destroyed instruments upon the bridge;
every officer and man should know when we crossed thirty.
But then I should assert the spirit which dominated me, I
should resist arrest, and insist upon bringing my ship back
across the dead line, remaining at my post until we had
reached New York.  Then I should make a full report, and
with it a demand upon public opinion that the dead lines be
wiped forever from the seas.

I knew that I was right.  I knew that no more loyal officer
wore the uniform of the navy.  I knew that I was a good
officer and sailor, and I didn't propose submitting to
degradation and discharge because a lot of old, preglacial
fossils had declared over two hundred years before that no
man should cross thirty.

Even while these thoughts were passing through my mind I was
busy with the details of my duties.  I had seen to it that a
sea anchor was rigged, and even now the men had completed
their task, and the Coldwater was swinging around rapidly,
her nose pointing once more into the wind, and the frightful
rolling consequent upon her wallowing in the trough was
happily diminishing.

It was then that Johnson came hurrying to the bridge.  One
of his eyes was swollen and already darkening, and his lip
was cut and bleeding.  Without even the formality of a
salute, he burst upon me, white with fury.

"Lieutenant Alvarez attacked me!" he cried.  "I demand that
he be placed under arrest.  I found him in the act of
destroying the reserve instruments, and when I would have
interfered to protect them he fell upon me and beat me.  I
demand that you arrest him!"

"You forget yourself, Mr. Johnson," I said.  "You are not in
command of the ship.  I deplore the action of Lieutenant
Alvarez, but I cannot expunge from my mind the loyalty and
self-sacrificing friendship which has prompted him to his
acts.  Were I you, sir, I should profit by the example he
has set.  Further, Mr. Johnson, I intend retaining command
of the ship, even though she crosses thirty, and I shall
demand implicit obedience from every officer and man aboard
until I am properly relieved from duty by a superior officer
in the port of New York."

"You mean to say that you will cross thirty without
submitting to arrest?" he almost shouted.

"I do, sir," I replied.  "And now you may go below, and,
when again you find it necessary to address me, you will
please be so good as to bear in mind the fact that I am your
commanding officer, and as such entitled to a salute."

He flushed, hesitated a moment, and then, saluting, turned
upon his heel and left the bridge.  Shortly after, Alvarez
appeared.  He was pale, and seemed to have aged ten years in
the few brief minutes since I last had seen him.  Saluting,
he told me very simply what he had done, and asked that I
place him under arrest.

I put my hand on his shoulder, and I guess that my voice
trembled a trifle as, while reproving him for his act, I
made it plain to him that my gratitude was no less potent a
force than his loyalty to me.  Then it was that I outlined
to him my purpose to defy the regulation that had raised the
dead lines, and to take my ship back to New York myself.

I did not ask him to share the responsibility with me.  I
merely stated that I should refuse to submit to arrest, and
that I should demand of him and every other officer and man
implicit obedience to my every command until we docked at
home.

His face brightened at my words, and he assured me that I
would find him as ready to acknowledge my command upon the
wrong side of thirty as upon the right, an assurance which I
hastened to tell him I did not need.

The storm continued to rage for three days, and as far as
the wind scarce varied a point during all that time, I knew
that we must be far beyond thirty, drifting rapidly east by
south.  All this time it had been impossible to work upon
the damaged engines or the gravity-screen generators; but we
had a full set of instruments upon the bridge, for Alvarez,
after discovering my intentions, had fetched the reserve
instruments from his own cabin, where he had hidden them.
Those which Johnson had seen him destroy had been a third
set which only Alvarez had known was aboard the Coldwater.

We waited impatiently for the sun, that we might determine
our exact location, and upon the fourth day our vigil was
rewarded a few minutes before noon.

Every officer and man aboard was tense with nervous
excitement as we awaited the result of the reading.  The
crew had known almost as soon as I that we were doomed to
cross thirty, and I am inclined to believe that every man
jack of them was tickled to death, for the spirits of
adventure and romance still live in the hearts of men of the
twenty-second century, even though there be little for them
to feed upon between thirty and one hundred seventy-five.

The men carried none of the burdens of responsibility.  They
might cross thirty with impunity, and doubtless they would
return to be heroes at home; but how different the home-
coming of their commanding officer!

The wind had dropped to a steady blow, still from west by
north, and the sea had gone down correspondingly.  The crew,
with the exception of those whose duties kept them below,
were ranged on deck below the bridge.  When our position was
definitely fixed I personally announced it to the eager,
waiting men.

"Men," I said, stepping forward to the handrail and looking
down into their upturned, bronzed faces, "you are anxiously
awaiting information as to the ship's position.  It has been
determined at latitude fifty degrees seven minutes north,
longitude twenty degrees sixteen minutes west."

I paused and a buzz of animated comment ran through the
massed men beneath me.  "Beyond thirty.  But there will be
no change in commanding officers, in routine or in
discipline, until after we have docked again in New York."

As I ceased speaking and stepped back from the rail there
was a roar of applause from the deck such as I never before
had heard aboard a ship of peace.  It recalled to my mind
tales that I had read of the good old days when naval
vessels were built to fight, when ships of peace had been
man-of-war, and guns had flashed in other than futile target
practice, and decks had run red with blood.

With the subsistence of the sea, we were able to go to work
upon the damaged engines to some effect, and I also set men
to examining the gravitation-screen generators with a view
to putting them in working order should it prove not beyond
our resources.

For two weeks we labored at the engines, which indisputably
showed evidence of having been tampered with.  I appointed a
board to investigate and report upon the disaster.  But it
accomplished nothing other than to convince me that there
were several officers upon it who were in full sympathy with
Johnson, for, though no charges had been preferred against
him, the board went out of its way specifically to exonerate
him in its findings.

All this time we were drifting almost due east.  The work
upon the engines had progressed to such an extent that
within a few hours we might expect to be able to proceed
under our own power westward in the direction of Pan-
American waters.

To relieve the monotony I had taken to fishing, and early
that morning I had departed from the Coldwater in one of the
boats on such an excursion.  A gentle west wind was blowing.
The sea shimmered in the sunlight.  A cloudless sky canopied
the west for our sport, as I had made it a point never
voluntarily to make an inch toward the east that I could
avoid.  At least, they should not be able to charge me with
a willful violation of the dead lines regulation.

I had with me only the boat's ordinary complement of men--
three in all, and more than enough to handle any small power
boat.  I had not asked any of my officers to accompany me,
as I wished to be alone, and very glad am I now that I had
not.  My only regret is that, in view of what befell us, it
had been necessary to bring the three brave fellows who
manned the boat.

Our fishing, which proved excellent, carried us so far to
the west that we no longer could see the Coldwater.  The day
wore on, until at last, about mid-afternoon, I gave the
order to return to the ship.

We had proceeded but a short distance toward the east when
one of the men gave an exclamation of excitement, at the
same time pointing eastward.  We all looked on in the
direction he had indicated, and there, a short distance
above the horizon, we saw the outlines of the Coldwater
silhouetted against the sky.

"They've repaired the engines and the generators both,"
exclaimed one of the men.

It seemed impossible, but yet it had evidently been done.
Only that morning, Lieutenant Johnson had told me that he
feared that it would be impossible to repair the generators.
I had put him in charge of this work, since he always had
been accounted one of the best gravitation-screen men in
the navy.  He had invented several of the improvements that
are incorporated in the later models of these generators,
and I am convinced that he knows more concerning both the
theory and the practice of screening gravitation than any
living Pan-American.

At the sight of the Coldwater once more under control, the
three men burst into a glad cheer.  But, for some reason
which I could not then account, I was strangely overcome by
a premonition of personal misfortune.  It was not that I now
anticipated an early return to Pan-America and a board of
inquiry, for I had rather looked forward to the fight that
must follow my return.  No, there was something else,
something indefinable and vague that cast a strange gloom
upon me as I saw my ship rising farther above the water and
making straight in our direction.

I was not long in ascertaining a possible explanation of my
depression, for, though we were plainly visible from the
bridge of the aero-submarine and to the hundreds of men who
swarmed her deck, the ship passed directly above us, not
five hundred feet from the water, and sped directly
westward.

We all shouted, and I fired my pistol to attract their
attention, though I knew full well that all who cared to had
observed us, but the ship moved steadily away, growing
smaller and smaller to our view until at last she passed
completely out of sight.

What could it mean?  I had left Alvarez in command.  He was
my most loyal subordinate.  It was absolutely beyond the
pale of possibility that Alvarez should desert me.  No,
there was some other explanation.  Something occurred to
place my second officer, Porfirio Johnson, in command.  I
was sure of it but why speculate?  The futility of
conjecture was only too palpable.  The Coldwater had
abandoned us in midocean.  Doubtless none of us would
survive to know why.

The young man at the wheel of the power boat had turned her
nose about as it became evident that the ship intended
passing over us, and now he still held her in futile pursuit
of the Coldwater.

"Bring her about, Snider," I directed, "and hold her due
east.  We can't catch the Coldwater, and we can't cross the
Atlantic in this.  Our only hope lies in making the nearest
land, which, unless I am mistaken, is the Scilly Islands,
off the southwest coast of England.  Ever heard of England,
Snider?"

"There's a part of the United States of North America that
used to be known to the ancients as New England," he
replied.  "Is that where you mean, sir?"

"No, Snider," I replied.  "The England I refer to was an
island off the continent of Europe.  It was the seat of a
very powerful kingdom that flourished over two hundred years
ago.  A part of the United States of North America and all
of the Federated States of Canada once belonged to this
ancient England."

"Europe," breathed one of the men, his voice tense with
excitement.  "My grandfather used to tell me stories of the
world beyond thirty.  He had been a great student, and he
had read much from forbidden books."

"In which I resemble your grandfather," I said, "for I, too,
have read more even than naval officers are supposed to
read, and, as you men know, we are permitted a greater
latitude in the study of geography and history than men of
other professions.

"Among the books and papers of Admiral Porter Turck, who
lived two hundred years ago, and from whom I am descended,
many volumes still exist, and are in my possession, which
deal with the history and geography of ancient Europe.
Usually I bring several of these books with me upon a
cruise, and this time, among others, I have maps of Europe
and her surrounding waters.  I was studying them as we came
away from the Coldwater this morning, and luckily I have
them with me."

"You are going to try to make Europe, sir?" asked Taylor,
the young man who had last spoken.

"It is the nearest land," I replied.  "I have always wanted
to explore the forgotten lands of the Eastern Hemisphere.
Here's our chance.  To remain at sea is to perish.  None of
us ever will see home again.  Let us make the best of it,
and enjoy while we do live that which is forbidden the
balance of our race--the adventure and the mystery which lie
beyond thirty."

Taylor and Delcarte seized the spirit of my mood but Snider,
I think, was a trifle sceptical.

"It is treason, sir," I replied, "but there is no law which
compels us to visit punishment upon ourselves.  Could we
return to Pan-America, I should be the first to insist that
we face it.  But we know that's not possible.  Even if this
craft would carry us so far, we haven't enough water or food
for more than three days.

"We are doomed, Snider, to die far from home and without
ever again looking upon the face of another fellow
countryman than those who sit here now in this boat.  Isn't
that punishment sufficient for even the most exacting
judge?"

Even Snider had to admit that it was.

"Very well, then, let us live while we live, and enjoy to
the fullest whatever of adventure or pleasure each new day
brings, since any day may be our last, and we shall be dead
for a considerable while."

I could see that Snider was still fearful, but Taylor and
Delcarte responded with a hearty, "Aye, aye, sir!"

They were of different mold.  Both were sons of naval
officers.  They represented the aristocracy of birth, and
they dared to think for themselves.

Snider was in the minority, and so we continued toward the
east.  Beyond thirty, and separated from my ship, my
authority ceased.  I held leadership, if I was to hold it at
all, by virtue of personal qualifications only, but I did
not doubt my ability to remain the director of our destinies
in so far as they were amenable to human agencies.  I have
always led.  While my brain and brawn remain unimpaired I
shall continue always to lead.  Following is an art which
Turcks do not easily learn.

It was not until the third day that we raised land, dead
ahead, which I took, from my map, to be the isles of Scilly.
But such a gale was blowing that I did not dare attempt to
land, and so we passed to the north of them, skirted Land's
End, and entered the English Channel.

I think that up to that moment I had never experienced such
a thrill as passed through me when I realized that I was
navigating these historic waters.  The lifelong dreams that
I never had dared hope to see fulfilled were at last a
reality--but under what forlorn circumstances!

Never could I return to my native land.  To the end of my
days I must remain in exile.  Yet even these thoughts failed
to dampen my ardor.

My eyes scanned the waters.  To the north I could see the
rockbound coast of Cornwall.  Mine were the first American
eyes to rest upon it for more than two hundred years.  In
vain, I searched for some sign of ancient commerce that, if
history is to be believed, must have dotted the bosom of the
Channel with white sails and blackened the heavens with the
smoke of countless funnels, but as far as eye could reach
the tossing waters of the Channel were empty and deserted.

Toward midnight the wind and sea abated, so that shortly
after dawn I determined to make inshore in an attempt to
effect a landing, for we were sadly in need of fresh water
and food.

According to my observations, we were just off Ram Head, and
it was my intention to enter Plymouth Bay and visit
Plymouth.  From my map it appeared that this city lay back
from the coast a short distance, and there was another city
given as Devonport, which appeared to lie at the mouth of
the river Tamar.

However, I knew that it would make little difference which
city we entered, as the English people were famed of old for
their hospitality toward visiting mariners.  As we
approached the mouth of the bay I looked for the fishing
craft which I expected to see emerging thus early in the day
for their labors.  But even after we rounded Ram Head and
were well within the waters of the bay I saw no vessel.
Neither was there buoy nor light nor any other mark to show
larger ships the channel, and I wondered much at this.

The coast was densely overgrown, nor was any building or
sign of man apparent from the water.  Up the bay and into
the River Tamar we motored through a solitude as unbroken as
that which rested upon the waters of the Channel.  For all
we could see, there was no indication that man had ever set
his foot upon this silent coast.

I was nonplused, and then, for the first time, there crept
over me an intuition of the truth.

Here was no sign of war.  As far as this portion of the
Devon coast was concerned, that seemed to have been over for
many years, but neither were there any people.  Yet I could
not find it within myself to believe that I should find no
inhabitants in England.  Reasoning thus, I discovered that
it was improbable that a state of war still existed, and
that the people all had been drawn from this portion of
England to some other, where they might better defend
themselves against an invader.

But what of their ancient coast defenses?  What was there
here in Plymouth Bay to prevent an enemy landing in force
and marching where they wished?  Nothing.  I could not
believe that any enlightened military nation, such as the
ancient English are reputed to have been, would have
voluntarily so deserted an exposed coast and an excellent
harbor to the mercies of an enemy.

I found myself becoming more and more deeply involved in
quandary.  The puzzle which confronted me I could not
unravel.  We had landed, and I now stood upon the spot
where, according to my map, a large city should rear its
spires and chimneys.  There was nothing but rough, broken
ground covered densely with weeds and brambles, and tall,
rank, grass.

Had a city ever stood there, no sign of it remained.  The
roughness and unevenness of the ground suggested something
of a great mass of debris hidden by the accumulation of
centuries of undergrowth.

I drew the short cutlass with which both officers and men of
the navy are, as you know, armed out of courtesy to the
traditions and memories of the past, and with its point dug
into the loam about the roots of the vegetation growing at
my feet.

The blade entered the soil for a matter of seven inches,
when it struck upon something stonelike.  Digging about the
obstacle, I presently loosened it, and when I had withdrawn
it from its sepulcher I found the thing to be an ancient
brick of clay, baked in an oven.

Delcarte we had left in charge of the boat; but Snider and
Taylor were with me, and following my example, each engaged
in the fascinating sport of prospecting for antiques.  Each
of us uncovered a great number of these bricks, until we
commenced to weary of the monotony of it, when Snider
suddenly gave an exclamation of excitement, and, as I turned
to look, he held up a human skull for my inspection.

I took it from him and examined it.  Directly in the center
of the forehead was a small round hole.  The gentleman had
evidently come to his end defending his country from an
invader.

Snider again held aloft another trophy of the search--a
metal spike and some tarnished and corroded metal ornaments.
They had lain close beside the skull.

With the point of his cutlass Snider scraped the dirt and
verdigris from the face of the larger ornament.

"An inscription," he said, and handed the thing to me.

They were the spike and ornaments of an ancient German
helmet.  Before long we had uncovered many other indications
that a great battle had been fought upon the ground where we
stood.  But I was then, and still am, at loss to account for
the presence of German soldiers upon the English coast so
far from London, which history suggests would have been the
natural goal of an invader.

I can only account for it by assuming that either England
was temporarily conquered by the Teutons, or that an
invasion of so vast proportions was undertaken that German
troops were hurled upon the England coast in huge numbers
and that landings were necessarily effected at many places
simultaneously.  Subsequent discoveries tend to strengthen
this view.

We dug about for a short time with our cutlasses until I
became convinced that a city had stood upon the spot at some
time in the past, and that beneath our feet, crumbled and
dead, lay ancient Devonport.

I could not repress a sigh at the thought of the havoc war
had wrought in this part of England, at least.  Farther
east, nearer London, we should find things very different.
There would be the civilization that two centuries must have
wrought upon our English cousins as they had upon us.  There
would be mighty cities, cultivated fields, happy people.
There we would be welcomed as long-lost brothers.  There
would we find a great nation anxious to learn of the world
beyond their side of thirty, as I had been anxious to learn
of that which lay beyond our side of the dead line.

I turned back toward the boat.

"Come, men!" I said.  "We will go up the river and fill our
casks with fresh water, search for food and fuel, and then
tomorrow be in readiness to push on toward the east.  I am
going to London."

The report of a gun blasted the silence of a dead Devonport
with startling abruptness.

It came from the direction of the launch, and in an instant
we three were running for the boat as fast as our legs would
carry us.  As we came in sight of it we saw Delcarte a
hundred yards inland from the launch, leaning over something
which lay upon the ground.  As we called to him he waved his
cap, and stooping, lifted a small deer for our inspection.

I was about to congratulate him on his trophy when we were
startled by a horrid, half-human, half-bestial scream a
little ahead and to the right of us.  It seemed to come from
a clump of rank and tangled bush not far from where Delcarte
stood.  It was a horrid, fearsome sound, the like of which
never had fallen upon my ears before.

We looked in the direction from which it came.  The smile
had died from Delcarte's lips.  Even at the distance we were
from him I saw his face go suddenly white, and he quickly
threw his rifle to his shoulder.  At the same moment the
thing that had given tongue to the cry moved from the
concealing brushwood far enough for us, too, to see it.

Both Taylor and Snider gave little gasps of astonishment and
dismay.

"What is it, sir?" asked the latter.

The creature stood about the height of a tall man's waist,
and was long and gaunt and sinuous, with a tawny coat
striped with black, and with white throat and belly.  In
conformation it was similar to a cat--a huge cat,
exaggerated colossal cat, with fiendish eyes and the most
devilish cast of countenance, as it wrinkled its bristling
snout and bared its great yellow fangs.

It was pacing, or rather, slinking, straight for Delcarte,
who had now leveled his rifle upon it.

"What is it, sir?" mumbled Snider again, and then a half-
forgotten picture from an old natural history sprang to my
mind, and I recognized in the frightful beast the Felis
tigris of ancient Asia, specimens of which had, in former
centuries, been exhibited in the Western Hemisphere.

Snider and Taylor were armed with rifles and revolvers,
while I carried only a revolver.  Seizing Snider's rifle
from his trembling hands, I called to Taylor to follow me,
and together we ran forward, shouting, to attract the
beast's attention from Delcarte until we should all be quite
close enough to attack with the greatest assurance of
success.

I cried to Delcarte not to fire until we reached his side,
for I was fearful lest our small caliber, steel-jacketed
bullets should, far from killing the beast, tend merely to
enrage it still further.  But he misunderstood me, thinking
that I had ordered him to fire.

With the report of his rifle the tiger stopped short in
apparent surprise, then turned and bit savagely at its
shoulder for an instant, after which it wheeled again toward
Delcarte, issuing the most terrific roars and screams, and
launched itself, with incredible speed, toward the brave
fellow, who now stood his ground pumping bullets from his
automatic rifle as rapidly as the weapon would fire.

Taylor and I also opened up on the creature, and as it was
broadside to us it offered a splendid target, though for all
the impression we appeared to make upon the great cat we
might as well have been launching soap bubbles at it.

Straight as a torpedo it rushed for Delcarte, and, as Taylor
and I stumbled on through the tall grass toward our
unfortunate comrade, we saw the tiger rear upon him and
crush him to the earth.

Not a backward step had the noble Delcarte taken.  Two
hundred years of peace had not sapped the red blood from his
courageous line.  He went down beneath that avalanche of
bestial savagery still working his gun and with his face
toward his antagonist.  Even in the instant that I thought
him dead I could not help but feel a thrill of pride that he
was one of my men, one of my class, a Pan-American gentleman
of birth.  And that he had demonstrated one of the principal
contentions of the army-and-navy adherents--that military
training was necessary for the salvation of personal courage
in the Pan-American race which for generations had had to
face no dangers more grave than those incident to ordinary
life in a highly civilized community, safeguarded by every
means at the disposal of a perfectly organized and all-
powerful government utilizing the best that advanced science
could suggest.

As we ran toward Delcarte, both Taylor and I were struck by
the fact that the beast upon him appeared not to be mauling
him, but lay quiet and motionless upon its prey, and when we
were quite close, and the muzzles of our guns were at the
animal's head, I saw the explanation of this sudden
cessation of hostilities--Felis tigris was dead.

One of our bullets, or one of the last that Delcarte fired,
had penetrated the heart, and the beast had died even as it
sprawled forward crushing Delcarte to the ground.

A moment later, with our assistance, the man had scrambled
from beneath the carcass of his would-be slayer, without a
scratch to indicate how close to death he had been.

Delcarte's buoyance was entirely unruffled.  He came from
under the tiger with a broad grin on his handsome face, nor
could I perceive that a muscle trembled or that his voice
showed the least indication of nervousness or excitement.

With the termination of the adventure, we began to speculate
upon the explanation of the presence of this savage brute at
large so great a distance from its native habitat.  My
readings had taught me that it was practically unknown
outside of Asia, and that, so late as the twentieth century,
at least, there had been no savage beasts outside captivity
in England.

As we talked, Snider joined us, and I returned his rifle to
him.  Taylor and Delcarte picked up the slain deer, and we
all started down toward the launch, walking slowly.
Delcarte wanted to fetch the tiger's skin, but I had to deny
him permission, since we had no means to properly cure it.

Upon the beach, we skinned the deer and cut away as much
meat as we thought we could dispose of, and as we were again
embarking to continue up the river for fresh water and fuel,
we were startled by a series of screams from the bushes a
short distance away.

"Another Felis tigris," said Taylor.

"Or a dozen of them," supplemented Delcarte, and, even as he
spoke, there leaped into sight, one after another, eight of
the beasts, full grown--magnificent specimens.

At the sight of us, they came charging down like infuriated
demons.  I saw that three rifles would be no match for them,
and so I gave the word to put out from shore, hoping that
the "tiger," as the ancients called him, could not swim.

Sure enough, they all halted at the beach, pacing back and
forth, uttering fiendish cries, and glaring at us in the
most malevolent manner.

As we motored away, we presently heard the calls of similar
animals far inland.  They seemed to be answering the cries
of their fellows at the water's edge, and from the wide
distribution and great volume of the sound we came to the
conclusion that enormous numbers of these beasts must roam
the adjacent country.

"They have eaten up the inhabitants," murmured Snider,
shuddering.

"I imagine you are right," I agreed, "for their extreme
boldness and fearlessness in the presence of man would
suggest either that man is entirely unknown to them, or that
they are extremely familiar with him as their natural and
most easily procured prey."

"But where did they come from?" asked Delcarte.  "Could they
have traveled here from Asia?"

I shook my head.  The thing was a puzzle to me.  I knew that
it was practically beyond reason to imagine that tigers had
crossed the mountain ranges and rivers and all the great
continent of Europe to travel this far from their native
lairs, and entirely impossible that they should have crossed
the English Channel at all.  Yet here they were, and in
great numbers.

We continued up the Tamar several miles, filled our casks,
and then landed to cook some of our deer steak, and have the
first square meal that had fallen to our lot since the
Coldwater deserted us.  But scarce had we built our fire and
prepared the meat for cooking than Snider, whose eyes had
been constantly roving about the landscape from the moment
that we left the launch, touched me on the arm and pointed
to a clump of bushes which grew a couple of hundred yards
away.

Half concealed behind their screening foliage I saw the
yellow and black of a big tiger, and, as I looked, the beast
stalked majestically toward us.  A moment later, he was
followed by another and another, and it is needless to state
that we beat a hasty retreat to the launch.

The country was apparently infested by these huge Carnivora,
for after three other attempts to land and cook our food we
were forced to abandon the idea entirely, as each time we
were driven off by hunting tigers.

It was also equally impossible to obtain the necessary
ingredients for our chemical fuel, and, as we had very
little left aboard, we determined to step our folding mast
and proceed under sail, hoarding our fuel supply for use in
emergencies.

I may say that it was with no regret that we bid adieu to
Tigerland, as we rechristened the ancient Devon, and,
beating out into the Channel, turned the launch's nose
southeast, to round Bolt Head and continue up the coast
toward the Strait of Dover and the North Sea.

I was determined to reach London as soon as possible, that
we might obtain fresh clothing, meet with cultured people,
and learn from the lips of Englishmen the secrets of the two
centuries since the East had been divorced from the West.

Our first stopping place was the Isle of Wight.  We entered
the Solent about ten o'clock one morning, and I must confess
that my heart sank as we came close to shore.  No lighthouse
was visible, though one was plainly indicated upon my map.
Upon neither shore was sign of human habitation.  We skirted
the northern shore of the island in fruitless search for
man, and then at last landed upon an eastern point, where
Newport should have stood, but where only weeds and great
trees and tangled wild wood rioted, and not a single manmade
thing was visible to the eye.

Before landing, I had the men substitute soft bullets for
the steel-jacketed projectiles with which their belts and
magazines were filled.  Thus equipped, we felt upon more
even terms with the tigers, but there was no sign of the
tigers, and I decided that they must be confined to the
mainland.

After eating, we set out in search of fuel, leaving Taylor
to guard the launch.  For some reason I could not trust
Snider alone.  I knew that he looked with disapproval upon
my plan to visit England, and I did not know but what at his
first opportunity, he might desert us, taking the launch
with him, and attempt to return to Pan-America.

That he would be fool enough to venture it, I did not doubt.

We had gone inland for a mile or more, and were passing
through a park-like wood, when we came suddenly upon the
first human beings we had seen since we sighted the English
coast.

There were a score of men in the party.  Hairy, half-naked
men they were, resting in the shade of a great tree.  At the
first sight of us they sprang to their feet with wild yells,
seizing long spears that had lain beside them as they
rested.

For a matter of fifty yards they ran from us as rapidly as
they could, and then they turned and surveyed us for a
moment.  Evidently emboldened by the scarcity of our
numbers, they commenced to advance upon us, brandishing
their spears and shouting horribly.

They were short and muscular of build, with long hair and
beards tangled and matted with filth.  Their heads, however,
were shapely, and their eyes, though fierce and warlike,
were intelligent.

Appreciation of these physical attributes came later, of
course, when I had better opportunity to study the men at
close range and under circumstances less fraught with danger
and excitement.  At the moment I saw, and with unmixed
wonder, only a score of wild savages charging down upon us,
where I had expected to find a community of civilized and
enlightened people.

Each of us was armed with rifle, revolver, and cutlass, but
as we stood shoulder to shoulder facing the wild men I was
loath to give the command to fire upon them, inflicting
death or suffering upon strangers with whom we had no
quarrel, and so I attempted to restrain them for the moment
that we might parley with them.

To this end I raised my left hand above my head with the
palm toward them as the most natural gesture indicative of
peaceful intentions which occurred to me.  At the same time
I called aloud to them that we were friends, though, from
their appearance, there was nothing to indicate that they
might understand Pan-American, or ancient English, which are
of course practically identical.

At my gesture and words they ceased their shouting and came
to a halt a few paces from us.  Then, in deep tones, one who
was in advance of the others and whom I took to be the chief
or leader of the party replied in a tongue which while
intelligible to us, was so distorted from the English
language from which it evidently had sprung, that it was
with difficulty that we interpreted it.

"Who are you," he asked, "and from what country?"

I told him that we were from Pan-America, but he only shook
his head and asked where that was.  He had never heard of
it, or of the Atlantic Ocean which I told him separated his
country from mine.

"It has been two hundred years," I told him, "since a Pan-
American visited England."

"England?" he asked.  "What is England?"

"Why this is a part of England!" I exclaimed.

"This is Grubitten," he assured me.  "I know nothing about
England, and I have lived here all my life."

It was not until long after that the derivation of Grubitten
occurred to me.  Unquestionably it is a corruption of Great
Britain, a name formerly given to the large island
comprising England, Scotland and Wales.  Subsequently we
heard it pronounced Grabrittin and Grubritten.

I then asked the fellow if he could direct us to Ryde or
Newport; but again he shook his head, and said that he never
had heard of such countries.  And when I asked him if there
were any cities in this country he did not know what I
meant, never having heard the word cities.

I explained my meaning as best I could by stating that by
city I referred to a place where many people lived together
in houses.

"Oh," he exclaimed, "you mean a camp!  Yes, there are two
great camps here, East Camp and West Camp.  We are from East
Camp."

The use of the word camp to describe a collection of
habitations naturally suggested war to me, and my next
question was as to whether the war was over, and who had
been victorious.

"No," he replied to this question.  "The war is not yet
over.  But it soon will be, and it will end, as it always
does, with the Westenders running away.  We, the Eastenders,
are always victorious."

"No," I said, seeing that he referred to the petty tribal
wars of his little island, "I mean the Great War, the war
with Germany.  Is it ended--and who was victorious?"

He shook his head impatiently.

"I never heard," he said, "of any of these strange countries
of which you speak."

It seemed incredible, and yet it was true.  These people
living at the very seat of the Great War knew nothing of it,
though but two centuries had passed since, to our knowledge,
it had been running in the height of its titanic
frightfulness all about them, and to us upon the far side of
the Atlantic still was a subject of keen interest.

Here was a lifelong inhabitant of the Isle of Wight who
never had heard of either Germany or England!  I turned to
him quite suddenly with a new question.

"What people live upon the mainland?" I asked, and pointed
in the direction of the Hants coast.

"No one lives there," he replied.

"Long ago, it is said, my people dwelt across the waters
upon that other land; but the wild beasts devoured them in
such numbers that finally they were driven here, paddling
across upon logs and driftwood, nor has any dared return
since, because of the frightful creatures which dwell in
that horrid country."

"Do no other peoples ever come to your country in ships?" I
asked.

He never heard the word ship before, and did not know its
meaning.  But he assured me that until we came he had
thought that there were no other peoples in the world other
than the Grubittens, who consist of the Eastenders and the
Westenders of the ancient Isle of Wight.

Assured that we were inclined to friendliness, our new
acquaintances led us to their village, or, as they call it,
camp.  There we found a thousand people, perhaps, dwelling
in rude shelters, and living upon the fruits of the chase
and such sea food as is obtainable close to shore, for they
had no boats, nor any knowledge of such things.

Their weapons were most primitive, consisting of rude spears
tipped with pieces of metal pounded roughly into shape.
They had no literature, no religion, and recognized no law
other than the law of might.  They produced fire by striking
a bit of flint and steel together, but for the most part
they ate their food raw.  Marriage is unknown among them,
and while they have the word, mother, they did not know what
I meant by "father."  The males fight for the favor of the
females.  They practice infanticide, and kill the aged and
physically unfit.

The family consists of the mother and the children, the men
dwelling sometimes in one hut and sometimes in another.
Owing to their bloody duels, they are always numerically
inferior to the women, so there is shelter for them all.

We spent several hours in the village, where we were objects
of the greatest curiosity.  The inhabitants examined our
clothing and all our belongings, and asked innumerable
questions concerning the strange country from which we had
come and the manner of our coming.

I questioned many of them concerning past historical events,
but they knew nothing beyond the narrow limits of their
island and the savage, primitive life they led there.
London they had never heard of, and they assured me that I
would find no human beings upon the mainland.

Much saddened by what I had seen, I took my departure from
them, and the three of us made our way back to the launch,
accompanied by about five hundred men, women, girls, and
boys.

As we sailed away, after procuring the necessary ingredients
of our chemical fuel, the Grubittens lined the shore in
silent wonder at the strange sight of our dainty craft
dancing over the sparkling waters, and watched us until we
were lost to their sight.



4


It was during the morning of July 6, 2137, that we entered
the mouth of the Thames--to the best of my knowledge the
first Western keel to cut those historic waters for two
hundred and twenty-one years!

But where were the tugs and the lighters and the barges, the
lightships and the buoys, and all those countless attributes
which went to make up the myriad life of the ancient Thames?

Gone!  All gone!  Only silence and desolation reigned where
once the commerce of the world had centered.

I could not help but compare this once great water-way with
the waters about our New York, or Rio, or San Diego, or
Valparaiso.  They had become what they are today during the
two centuries of the profound peace which we of the navy
have been prone to deplore.  And what, during this same
period, had shorn the waters of the Thames of their pristine
grandeur?

Militarist that I am, I could find but a single word of
explanation--war!

I bowed my head and turned my eyes downward from the lonely
and depressing sight, and in a silence which none of us
seemed willing to break, we proceeded up the deserted river.

We had reached a point which, from my map, I imagined must
have been about the former site of Erith, when I discovered
a small band of antelope a short distance inland.  As we
were now entirely out of meat once more, and as I had given
up all expectations of finding a city upon the site of
ancient London, I determined to land and bag a couple of the
animals.

Assured that they would be timid and easily frightened, I
decided to stalk them alone, telling the men to wait at the
boat until I called to them to come and carry the carcasses
back to the shore.

Crawling carefully through the vegetation, making use of
such trees and bushes as afforded shelter, I came at last
almost within easy range of my quarry, when the antlered
head of the buck went suddenly into the air, and then, as
though in accordance with a prearranged signal, the whole
band moved slowly off, farther inland.

As their pace was leisurely, I determined to follow them
until I came again within range, as I was sure that they
would stop and feed in a short time.

They must have led me a mile or more at least before they
again halted and commenced to browse upon the rank,
luxuriant grasses.  All the time that I had followed them I
had kept both eyes and ears alert for sign or sound that
would indicate the presence of Felis tigris; but so far not
the slightest indication of the beast had been apparent.

As I crept closer to the antelope, sure this time of a good
shot at a large buck, I suddenly saw something that caused
me to forget all about my prey in wonderment.

It was the figure of an immense grey-black creature, rearing
its colossal shoulders twelve or fourteen feet above the
ground.  Never in my life had I seen such a beast, nor did I
at first recognize it, so different in appearance is the
live reality from the stuffed, unnatural specimens preserved
to us in our museums.

But presently I guessed the identity of the mighty creature
as Elephas africanus, or, as the ancients commonly described
it, African elephant.

The antelope, although in plain view of the huge beast, paid
not the slightest attention to it, and I was so wrapped up
in watching the mighty pachyderm that I quite forgot to
shoot at the buck and presently, and in quite a startling
manner, it became impossible to do so.

The elephant was browsing upon the young and tender shoots
of some low bushes, waving his great ears and switching his
short tail.  The antelope, scarce twenty paces from him,
continued their feeding, when suddenly, from close beside
the latter, there came a most terrifying roar, and I saw a
great, tawny body shoot, from the concealing verdure beyond
the antelope, full upon the back of a small buck.

Instantly the scene changed from one of quiet and peace to
indescribable chaos.  The startled and terrified buck
uttered cries of agony.  His fellows broke and leaped off in
all directions.  The elephant raised his trunk, and,
trumpeting loudly, lumbered off through the wood, crushing
down small trees and trampling bushes in his mad flight.

Growling horribly, a huge lion stood across the body of his
prey--such a creature as no Pan-American of the twenty-
second century had ever beheld until my eyes rested upon
this lordly specimen of "the king of beasts."  But what a
different creature was this fierce-eyed demon, palpitating
with life and vigor, glossy of coat, alert, growling,
magnificent, from the dingy, moth-eaten replicas beneath
their glass cases in the stuffy halls of our public museums.

I had never hoped or expected to see a living lion, tiger,
or elephant--using the common terms that were familiar to
the ancients, since they seem to me less unwieldy than those
now in general use among us--and so it was with sentiments
not unmixed with awe that I stood gazing at this regal beast
as, above the carcass of his kill, he roared out his
challenge to the world.

So enthralled was I by the spectacle that I quite forgot
myself, and the better to view him, the great lion, I had
risen to my feet and stood, not fifty paces from him, in
full view.

For a moment he did not see me, his attention being directed
toward the retreating elephant, and I had ample time to
feast my eyes upon his splendid proportions, his great head,
and his thick black mane.

Ah, what thoughts passed through my mind in those brief
moments as I stood there in rapt fascination!  I had come to
find a wondrous civilization, and instead I found a wild-
beast monarch of the realm where English kings had ruled.  A
lion reigned, undisturbed, within a few miles of the seat of
one of the greatest governments the world has ever known,
his domain a howling wilderness, where yesterday fell the
shadows of the largest city in the world.

It was appalling; but my reflections upon this depressing
subject were doomed to sudden extinction.  The lion had
discovered me.

For an instant he stood silent and motionless as one of the
mangy effigies at home, but only for an instant.  Then, with
a most ferocious roar, and without the slightest hesitancy
or warning, he charged upon me.

He forsook the prey already dead beneath him for the
pleasures of the delectable tidbit, man.  From the
remorselessness with which the great Carnivora of modern
England hunted man, I am constrained to believe that,
whatever their appetites in times past, they have cultivated
a gruesome taste for human flesh.

As I threw my rifle to my shoulder, I thanked God, the
ancient God of my ancestors, that I had replaced the hard-
jacketed bullets in my weapon with soft-nosed projectiles,
for though this was my first experience with Felis leo, I
knew the moment that I faced that charge that even my
wonderfully perfected firearm would be as futile as a
peashooter unless I chanced to place my first bullet in a
vital spot.

Unless you had seen it you could not believe credible the
speed of a charging lion.  Apparently the animal is not
built for speed, nor can he maintain it for long.  But for a
matter of forty or fifty yards there is, I believe, no
animal on earth that can overtake him.

Like a bolt he bore down upon me, but, fortunately for me, I
did not lose my head.  I guessed that no bullet would kill
him instantly.  I doubted that I could pierce his skull.
There was hope, though, in finding his heart through his
exposed chest, or, better yet, of breaking his shoulder or
foreleg, and bringing him up long enough to pump more
bullets into him and finish him.

I covered his left shoulder and pulled the trigger as he was
almost upon me.  It stopped him.  With a terrific howl of
pain and rage, the brute rolled over and over upon the
ground almost to my feet.  As he came I pumped two more
bullets into him, and as he struggled to rise, clawing
viciously at me, I put a bullet in his spine.

That finished him, and I am free to admit that I was mighty
glad of it.  There was a great tree close behind me, and,
stepping within its shade, I leaned against it, wiping the
perspiration from my face, for the day was hot, and the
exertion and excitement left me exhausted.

I stood there, resting, for a moment, preparatory to turning
and retracing my steps to the launch, when, without warning,
something whizzed through space straight toward me.  There
was a dull thud of impact as it struck the tree, and as I
dodged to one side and turned to look at the thing I saw a
heavy spear imbedded in the wood not three inches from where
my head had been.

The thing had come from a little to one side of me, and,
without waiting to investigate at the instant, I leaped
behind the tree, and, circling it, peered around the other
side to get a sight of my would-be murderer.

This time I was pitted against men--the spear told me that
all too plainly--but so long as they didn't take me unawares
or from behind I had little fear of them.

Cautiously I edged about the far side of the trees until I
could obtain a view of the spot from which the spear must
have come, and when I did I saw the head of a man just
emerging from behind a bush.

The fellow was quite similar in type to those I had seen
upon the Isle of Wight.  He was hairy and unkempt, and as he
finally stepped into view I saw that he was garbed in the
same primitive fashion.

He stood for a moment gazing about in search of me, and then
he advanced.  As he did so a number of others, precisely
like him, stepped from the concealing verdure of nearby
bushes and followed in his wake.  Keeping the trees between
them and me, I ran back a short distance until I found a
clump of underbrush that would effectually conceal me, for I
wished to discover the strength of the party and its
armament before attempting to parley with it.

The useless destruction of any of these poor creatures was
the farthest idea from my mind.  I should have liked to have
spoken with them, but I did not care to risk having to use
my high-powered rifle upon them other than in the last
extremity.

Once in my new place of concealment, I watched them as they
approached the tree.  There were about thirty men in the
party and one woman--a girl whose hands seemed to be bound
behind her and who was being pulled along by two of the men.

They came forward warily, peering cautiously into every bush
and halting often.  At the body of the lion, they paused,
and I could see from their gesticulations and the higher
pitch of their voices that they were much excited over my
kill.

But presently they resumed their search for me, and as they
advanced I became suddenly aware of the unnecessary
brutality with which the girl's guards were treating her.
She stumbled once, not far from my place of concealment, and
after the balance of the party had passed me.  As she did so
one of the men at her side jerked her roughly to her feet
and struck her across the mouth with his fist.

Instantly my blood boiled, and forgetting every
consideration of caution, I leaped from my concealment, and,
springing to the man's side, felled him with a blow.

So unexpected had been my act that it found him and his
fellow unprepared; but instantly the latter drew the knife
that protruded from his belt and lunged viciously at me, at
the same time giving voice to a wild cry of alarm.

The girl shrank back at sight of me, her eyes wide in
astonishment, and then my antagonist was upon me.  I parried
his first blow with my forearm, at the same time delivering
a powerful blow to his jaw that sent him reeling back; but
he was at me again in an instant, though in the brief
interim I had time to draw my revolver.

I saw his companion crawling slowly to his feet, and the
others of the party racing down upon me.  There was no time
to argue now, other than with the weapons we wore, and so,
as the fellow lunged at me again with the wicked-looking
knife, I covered his heart and pulled the trigger.

Without a sound, he slipped to the earth, and then I turned
the weapon upon the other guard, who was now about to attack
me.  He, too, collapsed, and I was alone with the astonished
girl.

The balance of the party was some twenty paces from us, but
coming rapidly.  I seized her arm and drew her after me
behind a nearby tree, for I had seen that with both their
comrades down the others were preparing to launch their
spears.

With the girl safe behind the tree, I stepped out in sight
of the advancing foe, shouting to them that I was no enemy,
and that they should halt and listen to me.  But for answer
they only yelled in derision and launched a couple of spears
at me, both of which missed.

I saw then that I must fight, yet still I hated to slay
them, and it was only as a final resort that I dropped two
of them with my rifle, bringing the others to a temporary
halt.  Again, I appealed to them to desist.  But they only
mistook my solicitude for them for fear, and, with shouts of
rage and derision, leaped forward once again to overwhelm
me.

It was now quite evident that I must punish them severely,
or--myself--die and relinquish the girl once more to her
captors.  Neither of these things had I the slightest notion
of doing, and so I again stepped from behind the tree, and,
with all the care and deliberation of target practice, I
commenced picking off the foremost of my assailants.

One by one the wild men dropped, yet on came the others,
fierce and vengeful, until, only a few remaining, these
seemed to realize the futility of combating my modern weapon
with their primitive spears, and, still howling wrathfully,
withdrew toward the west.

Now, for the first time, I had an opportunity to turn my
attention toward the girl, who had stood, silent and
motionless, behind me as I pumped death into my enemies and
hers from my automatic rifle.

She was of medium height, well formed, and with fine, clear-
cut features.  Her forehead was high, and her eyes both
intelligent and beautiful.  Exposure to the sun had browned
a smooth and velvety skin to a shade which seemed to enhance
rather than mar an altogether lovely picture of youthful
femininity.

A trace of apprehension marked her expression--I cannot call
it fear since I have learned to know her--and astonishment
was still apparent in her eyes.  She stood quite erect, her
hands still bound behind her, and met my gaze with level,
proud return.

"What language do you speak?" I asked.  "Do you understand
mine?"

"Yes," she replied.  "It is similar to my own.  I am
Grabritin.  What are you?"

"I am a Pan-American," I answered.  She shook her head.
"What is that?"

I pointed toward the west.  "Far away, across the ocean."

Her expression altered a trifle.  A slight frown contracted
her brow.  The expression of apprehension deepened.

"Take off your cap," she said, and when, to humor her
strange request, I did as she bid, she appeared relieved.
Then she edged to one side and leaned over seemingly to peer
behind me.  I turned quickly to see what she discovered, but
finding nothing, wheeled about to see that her expression
was once more altered.

"You are not from there?" and she pointed toward the east.
It was a half question.  "You are not from across the water
there?"

"No," I assured her.  "I am from Pan-America, far away to
the west.  Have you ever heard of Pan-America?"

She shook her head in negation.  "I do not care where you
are from," she explained, "if you are not from there, and I
am sure you are not, for the men from there have horns and
tails."

It was with difficulty that I restrained a smile.

"Who are the men from there?" I asked.

"They are bad men," she replied.  "Some of my people do not
believe that there are such creatures.  But we have a
legend--a very old, old legend, that once the men from there
came across to Grabritin.  They came upon the water, and
under the water, and even in the air.  They came in great
numbers, so that they rolled across the land like a great
gray fog.  They brought with them thunder and lightning and
smoke that killed, and they fell upon us and slew our people
by the thousands and the hundreds of thousands.  But at last
we drove them back to the water's edge, back into the sea,
where many were drowned.  Some escaped, and these our people
followed--men, women, and even children, we followed them
back.  That is all.  The legend says our people never
returned.  Maybe they were all killed.  Maybe they are still
there.  But this, also, is in the legend, that as we drove
the men back across the water they swore that they would
return, and that when they left our shores they would leave
no human being alive behind them.  I was afraid that you
were from there."

"By what name were these men called?" I asked.

"We call them only the 'men from there,'" she replied,
pointing toward the east.  "I have never heard that they had
another name."

In the light of what I knew of ancient history, it was not
difficult for me to guess the nationality of those she
described simply as "the men from over there."  But what
utter and appalling devastation the Great War must have
wrought to have erased not only every sign of civilization
from the face of this great land, but even the name of the
enemy from the knowledge and language of the people.

I could only account for it on the hypothesis that the
country had been entirely depopulated except for a few
scattered and forgotten children, who, in some marvelous
manner, had been preserved by Providence to re-populate the
land.  These children had, doubtless, been too young to
retain in their memories to transmit to their children any
but the vaguest suggestion of the cataclysm which had
overwhelmed their parents.

Professor Cortoran, since my return to Pan-America, has
suggested another theory which is not entirely without claim
to serious consideration.  He points out that it is quite
beyond the pale of human instinct to desert little children
as my theory suggests the ancient English must have done.
He is more inclined to believe that the expulsion of the foe
from England was synchronous with widespread victories by
the allies upon the continent, and that the people of
England merely emigrated from their ruined cities and their
devastated, blood-drenched fields to the mainland, in the
hope of finding, in the domain of the conquered enemy,
cities and farms which would replace those they had lost.

The learned professor assumes that while a long-continued
war had strengthened rather than weakened the instinct of
paternal devotion, it had also dulled other humanitarian
instincts, and raised to the first magnitude the law of the
survival of the fittest, with the result that when the
exodus took place the strong, the intelligent, and the
cunning, together with their offspring, crossed the waters
of the Channel or the North Sea to the continent, leaving in
unhappy England only the helpless inmates of asylums for the
feebleminded and insane.

My objections to this, that the present inhabitants of
England are mentally fit, and could therefore not have
descended from an ancestry of undiluted lunacy he brushes
aside with the assertion that insanity is not necessarily
hereditary; and that even though it was, in many cases a
return to natural conditions from the state of high
civilization, which is thought to have induced mental
disease in the ancient world, would, after several
generations, have thoroughly expunged every trace of the
affliction from the brains and nerves of the descendants of
the original maniacs.

Personally, I do not place much stock in Professor
Cortoran's theory, though I admit that I am prejudiced.
Naturally one does not care to believe that the object of
his greatest affection is descended from a gibbering idiot
and a raving maniac.

But I am forgetting the continuity of my narrative--a
continuity which I desire to maintain, though I fear that I
shall often be led astray, so numerous and varied are the
bypaths of speculation which lead from the present day story
of the Grabritins into the mysterious past of their
forbears.

As I stood talking with the girl I presently recollected
that she still was bound, and with a word of apology, I drew
my knife and cut the rawhide thongs which confined her
wrists at her back.

She thanked me, and with such a sweet smile that I should
have been amply repaid by it for a much more arduous
service.

"And now," I said, "let me accompany you to your home and
see you safely again under the protection of your friends."

"No," she said, with a hint of alarm in her voice; "you must
not come with me--Buckingham will kill you."

Buckingham.  The name was famous in ancient English history.
Its survival, with many other illustrious names, is one of
the strongest arguments in refutal of Professor Cortoran's
theory; yet it opens no new doors to the past, and, on the
whole, rather adds to than dissipates the mystery.

"And who is Buckingham," I asked, "and why should he wish to
kill me?"

"He would think that you had stolen me," she replied, "and
as he wishes me for himself, he will kill any other whom he
thinks desires me.  He killed Wettin a few days ago.  My
mother told me once that Wettin was my father.  He was king.
Now Buckingham is king."

Here, evidently, were a people slightly superior to those of
the Isle of Wight.  These must have at least the rudiments
of civilized government since they recognized one among them
as ruler, with the title, king.  Also, they retained the
word father.  The girl's pronunciation, while far from
identical with ours, was much closer than the tortured
dialect of the Eastenders of the Isle of Wight.  The longer
I talked with her the more hopeful I became of finding here,
among her people, some records, or traditions, which might
assist in clearing up the historic enigma of the past two
centuries.  I asked her if we were far from the city of
London, but she did not know what I meant.  When I tried to
explain, describing mighty buildings of stone and brick,
broad avenues, parks, palaces, and countless people, she but
shook her head sadly.

"There is no such place near by," she said.  "Only the Camp
of the Lions has places of stone where the beasts lair, but
there are no people in the Camp of the Lions.  Who would
dare go there!"  And she shuddered.

"The Camp of the Lions," I repeated.  "And where is that,
and what?"

"It is there," she said, pointing up the river toward the
west.  "I have seen it from a great distance, but I have
never been there.  We are much afraid of the lions, for this
is their country, and they are angry that man has come to
live here.

"Far away there," and she pointed toward the south-west, "is
the land of tigers, which is even worse than this, the land
of the lions, for the tigers are more numerous than the
lions and hungrier for human flesh.  There were tigers here
long ago, but both the lions and the men set upon them and
drove them off."

"Where did these savage beasts come from?" I asked.

"Oh," she replied, "they have been here always.  It is their
country."

"Do they not kill and eat your people?" I asked.

"Often, when we meet them by accident, and we are too few to
slay them, or when one goes too close to their camp.  But
seldom do they hunt us, for they find what food they need
among the deer and wild cattle, and, too, we make them
gifts, for are we not intruders in their country?  Really we
live upon good terms with them, though I should not care to
meet one were there not many spears in my party."

"I should like to visit this Camp of the Lions," I said.

"Oh, no, you must not!" cried the girl.  "That would be
terrible.  They would eat you."  For a moment, then, she
seemed lost in thought, but presently she turned upon me
with: "You must go now, for any minute Buckingham may come
in search of me.  Long since should they have learned that I
am gone from the camp--they watch over me very closely--and
they will set out after me.  Go!  I shall wait here until
they come in search of me."

"No," I told her.  "I'll not leave you alone in a land
infested by lions and other wild beasts.  If you won't let
me go as far as your camp with you, then I'll wait here
until they come in search of you."

"Please go!" she begged.  "You have saved me, and I would
save you, but nothing will save you if Buckingham gets his
hands on you.  He is a bad man.  He wishes to have me for
his woman so that he may be king.  He would kill anyone who
befriended me, for fear that I might become another's."

"Didn't you say that Buckingham is already the king?" I
asked.

"He is.  He took my mother for his woman after he had killed
Wettin.  But my mother will die soon--she is very old--and
then the man to whom I belong will become king."

Finally, after much questioning, I got the thing through my
head.  It appears that the line of descent is through the
women.  A man is merely head of his wife's family--that is
all.  If she chances to be the oldest female member of the
"royal" house, he is king.  Very naively the girl explained
that there was seldom any doubt as to whom a child's mother
was.

This accounted for the girl's importance in the community
and for Buckingham's anxiety to claim her, though she told
me that she did not wish to become his woman, for he was a
bad man and would make a bad king.  But he was powerful, and
there was no other man who dared dispute his wishes.

"Why not come with me," I suggested, "if you do not wish to
become Buckingham's?"

"Where would you take me?" she asked.

Where, indeed!  I had not thought of that.  But before I
could reply to her question she shook her head and said,
"No, I cannot leave my people.  I must stay and do my best,
even if Buckingham gets me, but you must go at once.  Do not
wait until it is too late.  The lions have had no offering
for a long time, and Buckingham would seize upon the first
stranger as a gift to them."

I did not perfectly understand what she meant, and was about
to ask her when a heavy body leaped upon me from behind, and
great arms encircled my neck.  I struggled to free myself
and turn upon my antagonist, but in another instant I was
overwhelmed by a half dozen powerful, half-naked men, while
a score of others surrounded me, a couple of whom seized the
girl.

I fought as best I could for my liberty and for hers, but
the weight of numbers was too great, though I had the
satisfaction at least of giving them a good fight.

When they had overpowered me, and I stood, my hands bound
behind me, at the girl's side, she gazed commiseratingly at
me.

"It is too bad that you did not do as I bid you," she said,
"for now it has happened just as I feared--Buckingham has
you."

"Which is Buckingham?" I asked.

"I am Buckingham," growled a burly, unwashed brute,
swaggering truculently before me.  "And who are you who
would have stolen my woman?"

The girl spoke up then and tried to explain that I had not
stolen her; but on the contrary I had saved her from the men
from the "Elephant Country" who were carrying her away.

Buckingham only sneered at her explanation, and a moment
later gave the command that started us all off toward the
west.  We marched for a matter of an hour or so, coming at
last to a collection of rude huts, fashioned from branches
of trees covered with skins and grasses and sometimes
plastered with mud.  All about the camp they had erected a
wall of saplings pointed at the tops and fire hardened.

This palisade was a protection against both man and beasts,
and within it dwelt upward of two thousand persons, the
shelters being built very close together, and sometimes
partially underground, like deep trenches, with the poles
and hides above merely as protection from the sun and rain.

The older part of the camp consisted almost wholly of
trenches, as though this had been the original form of
dwellings which was slowly giving way to the drier and
airier surface domiciles.  In these trench habitations I saw
a survival of the military trenches which formed so famous a
part of the operation of the warring nations during the
twentieth century.

The women wore a single light deerskin about their hips, for
it was summer, and quite warm.  The men, too, were clothed
in a single garment, usually the pelt of some beast of prey.
The hair of both men and women was confined by a rawhide
thong passing about the forehead and tied behind.  In this
leathern band were stuck feathers, flowers, or the tails of
small mammals.  All wore necklaces of the teeth or claws of
wild beasts, and there were numerous metal wristlets and
anklets among them.

They wore, in fact, every indication of a most primitive
people--a race which had not yet risen to the heights of
agriculture or even the possession of domestic animals.
They were hunters--the lowest plane in the evolution of the
human race of which science takes cognizance.

And yet as I looked at their well shaped heads, their
handsome features, and their intelligent eyes, it was
difficult to believe that I was not among my own.  It was
only when I took into consideration their mode of living,
their scant apparel, the lack of every least luxury among
them, that I was forced to admit that they were, in truth,
but ignorant savages.

Buckingham had relieved me of my weapons, though he had not
the slightest idea of their purpose or uses, and when we
reached the camp he exhibited both me and my arms with every
indication of pride in this great capture.

The inhabitants flocked around me, examining my clothing,
and exclaiming in wonderment at each new discovery of
button, buckle, pocket, and flap.  It seemed incredible that
such a thing could be, almost within a stone's throw of the
spot where but a brief two centuries before had stood the
greatest city of the world.

They bound me to a small tree that grew in the middle of one
of their crooked streets, but the girl they released as soon
as we had entered the enclosure.  The people greeted her
with every mark of respect as she hastened to a large hut
near the center of the camp.

Presently she returned with a fine looking, white-haired
woman, who proved to be her mother.  The older woman carried
herself with a regal dignity that seemed quite remarkable in
a place of such primitive squalor.

The people fell aside as she approached, making a wide way
for her and her daughter.  When they had come near and
stopped before me the older woman addressed me.

"My daughter has told me," she said, "of the manner in which
you rescued her from the men of the elephant country.  If
Wettin lived you would be well treated, but Buckingham has
taken me now, and is king.  You can hope for nothing from
such a beast as Buckingham."

The fact that Buckingham stood within a pace of us and was
an interested listener appeared not to temper her
expressions in the slightest.

"Buckingham is a pig," she continued.  "He is a coward.  He
came upon Wettin from behind and ran his spear through him.
He will not be king for long.  Some one will make a face at
him, and he will run away and jump into the river."

The people began to titter and clap their hands.  Buckingham
became red in the face.  It was evident that he was far from
popular.

"If he dared," went on the old lady, "he would kill me now,
but he does not dare.  He is too great a coward.  If I could
help you I should gladly do so.  But I am only queen--the
vehicle that has helped carry down, unsullied, the royal
blood from the days when Grabritin was a mighty country."

The old queen's words had a noticeable effect upon the mob
of curious savages which surrounded me.  The moment they
discovered that the old queen was friendly to me and that I
had rescued her daughter they commenced to accord me a more
friendly interest, and I heard many words spoken in my
behalf, and demands were made that I not be harmed.

But now Buckingham interfered.  He had no intention of being
robbed of his prey.  Blustering and storming, he ordered the
people back to their huts, at the same time directing two of
his warriors to confine me in a dugout in one of the
trenches close to his own shelter.

Here they threw me upon the ground, binding my ankles
together and trussing them up to my wrists behind.  There
they left me, lying upon my stomach--a most uncomfortable
and strained position, to which was added the pain where the
cords cut into my flesh.

Just a few days ago my mind had been filled with the
anticipation of the friendly welcome I should find among the
cultured Englishmen of London.  Today I should be sitting in
the place of honor at the banquet board of one of London's
most exclusive clubs, feted and lionized.

The actuality!  Here I lay, bound hand and foot, doubtless
almost upon the very site of a part of ancient London, yet
all about me was a primeval wilderness, and I was a captive
of half-naked wild men.

I wondered what had become of Delcarte and Taylor and
Snider.  Would they search for me?  They could never find
me, I feared, yet if they did, what could they accomplish
against this horde of savage warriors?

Would that I could warn them.  I thought of the girl--
doubtless she could get word to them, but how was I to
communicate with her?  Would she come to see me before I was
killed?  It seemed incredible that she should not make some
slight attempt to befriend me; yet, as I recalled, she had
made no effort to speak with me after we had reached the
village.  She had hastened to her mother the moment she had
been liberated.  Though she had returned with the old queen,
she had not spoken to me, even then.  I began to have my
doubts.

Finally, I came to the conclusion that I was absolutely
friendless except for the old queen.  For some unaccountable
reason my rage against the girl for her ingratitude rose to
colossal proportions.

For a long time I waited for some one to come to my prison
whom I might ask to bear word to the queen, but I seemed to
have been forgotten.  The strained position in which I lay
became unbearable.  I wriggled and twisted until I managed
to turn myself partially upon my side, where I lay half
facing the entrance to the dugout.

Presently my attention was attracted by the shadow of
something moving in the trench without, and a moment later
the figure of a child appeared, creeping upon all fours, as,
wide-eyed, and prompted by childish curiosity, a little girl
crawled to the entrance of my hut and peered cautiously and
fearfully in.

I did not speak at first for fear of frightening the little
one away.  But when I was satisfied that her eyes had become
sufficiently accustomed to the subdued light of the
interior, I smiled.

Instantly the expression of fear faded from her eyes to be
replaced with an answering smile.

"Who are you, little girl?" I asked.

"My name is Mary," she replied.  "I am Victory's sister."

"And who is Victory?"

"You do not know who Victory is?" she asked, in
astonishment.

I shook my head in negation.

"You saved her from the elephant country people, and yet you
say you do not know her!" she exclaimed.

"Oh, so she is Victory, and you are her sister!  I have not
heard her name before.  That is why I did not know whom you
meant," I explained.  Here was just the messenger for me.
Fate was becoming more kind.

"Will you do something for me, Mary?" I asked.

"If I can."

"Go to your mother, the queen, and ask her to come to me," I
said.  "I have a favor to ask."

She said that she would, and with a parting smile she left
me.

For what seemed many hours I awaited her return, chafing
with impatience.  The afternoon wore on and night came, and
yet no one came near me.  My captors brought me neither food
nor water.  I was suffering considerable pain where the
rawhide thongs cut into my swollen flesh.  I thought that
they had either forgotten me, or that it was their intention
to leave me here to die of starvation.

Once I heard a great uproar in the village.  Men were
shouting--women were screaming and moaning.  After a time
this subsided, and again there was a long interval of
silence.

Half the night must have been spent when I heard a sound in
the trench near the hut.  It resembled muffled sobs.
Presently a figure appeared, silhouetted against the lesser
darkness beyond the doorway.  It crept inside the hut.

"Are you here?" whispered a childlike voice.

It was Mary!  She had returned.  The thongs no longer hurt
me.  The pangs of hunger and thirst disappeared.  I realized
that it had been loneliness from which I suffered most.

"Mary!" I exclaimed.  "You are a good girl.  You have come
back, after all.  I had commenced to think that you would
not.  Did you give my message to the queen?  Will she come?
Where is she?"

The child's sobs increased, and she flung herself upon the
dirt floor of the hut, apparently overcome by grief.

"What is it?" I asked.  "Why do you cry?"

"The queen, my mother, will not come to you," she said,
between sobs.  "She is dead.  Buckingham has killed her.
Now he will take Victory, for Victory is queen.  He kept us
fastened up in our shelter, for fear that Victory would
escape him, but I dug a hole beneath the back wall and got
out.  I came to you, because you saved Victory once before,
and I thought that you might save her again, and me, also.
Tell me that you will."

"I am bound and helpless, Mary," I replied.  "Otherwise I
would do what I could to save you and your sister."

"I will set you free!" cried the girl, creeping up to my
side.  "I will set you free, and then you may come and slay
Buckingham."

"Gladly!" I assented.

"We must hurry," she went on, as she fumbled with the hard
knots in the stiffened rawhide, "for Buckingham will be
after you soon.  He must make an offering to the lions at
dawn before he can take Victory.  The taking of a queen
requires a human offering!"

"And I am to be the offering?" I asked.

"Yes," she said, tugging at a knot.  "Buckingham has been
wanting a sacrifice ever since he killed Wettin, that he
might slay my mother and take Victory."

The thought was horrible, not solely because of the hideous
fate to which I was condemned, but from the contemplation it
engendered of the sad decadence of a once enlightened race.
To these depths of ignorance, brutality, and superstition
had the vaunted civilization of twentieth century England
been plunged, and by what?  War!  I felt the structure of
our time-honored militaristic arguments crumbling about me.

Mary labored with the thongs that confined me.  They proved
refractory--defying her tender, childish fingers.  She
assured me, however, that she would release me, if "they"
did not come too soon.

But, alas, they came.  We heard them coming down the trench,
and I bade Mary hide in a corner, lest she be discovered and
punished.  There was naught else she could do, and so she
crawled away into the Stygian blackness behind me.

Presently two warriors entered.  The leader exhibited a
unique method of discovering my whereabouts in the darkness.
He advanced slowly, kicking out viciously before him.
Finally he kicked me in the face.  Then he knew where I was.

A moment later I had been jerked roughly to my feet.  One of
the fellows stopped and severed the bonds that held my
ankles.  I could scarcely stand alone.  The two pulled and
hauled me through the low doorway and along the trench.  A
party of forty or fifty warriors were awaiting us at the
brink of the excavation some hundred yards from the hut.

Hands were lowered to us, and we were dragged to the
surface.  Then commenced a long march.  We stumbled through
the underbrush wet with dew, our way lighted by a score of
torchbearers who surrounded us.  But the torches were not to
light the way--that was but incidental.  They were carried
to keep off the huge Carnivora that moaned and coughed and
roared about us.

The noises were hideous.  The whole country seemed alive
with lions.  Yellow-green eyes blazed wickedly at us from
out the surrounding darkness.  My escort carried long, heavy
spears.  These they kept ever pointed toward the beast of
prey, and I learned from snatches of the conversation I
overheard that occasionally there might be a lion who would
brave even the terrors of fire to leap in upon human prey.
It was for such that the spears were always couched.

But nothing of the sort occurred during this hideous death
march, and with the first pale heralding of dawn we reached
our goal--an open place in the midst of a tangled wildwood.
Here rose in crumbling grandeur the first evidences I had
seen of the ancient civilization which once had graced fair
Albion--a single, time-worn arch of masonry.

"The entrance to the Camp of the Lions!" murmured one of the
party in a voice husky with awe.

Here the party knelt, while Buckingham recited a weird,
prayer-like chant.  It was rather long, and I recall only a
portion of it, which ran, if my memory serves me, somewhat
as follows:


        Lord of Grabritin, we         Fall on our knees to
thee,         This gift to bring.          Greatest of kings
are thou!         To thee we humbly bow!         Peace to
our camp allow.          God save thee, king!


Then the party rose, and dragging me to the crumbling arch,
made me fast to a huge, corroded, copper ring which was
dangling from an eyebolt imbedded in the masonry.

None of them, not even Buckingham, seemed to feel any
personal animosity toward me.  They were naturally rough and
brutal, as primitive men are supposed to have been since the
dawn of humanity, but they did not go out of their way to
maltreat me.

With the coming of dawn the number of lions about us seemed
to have greatly diminished--at least they made less noise--
and as Buckingham and his party disappeared into the woods,
leaving me alone to my terrible fate, I could hear the
grumblings and growlings of the beasts diminishing with the
sound of the chant, which the party still continued.  It
appeared that the lions had failed to note that I had been
left for their breakfast, and had followed off after their
worshippers instead.

But I knew the reprieve would be but for a short time, and
though I had no wish to die, I must confess that I rather
wished the ordeal over and the peace of oblivion upon me.

The voices of the men and the lions receded in the distance,
until finally quiet reigned about me, broken only by the
sweet voices of birds and the sighing of the summer wind in
the trees.

It seemed impossible to believe that in this peaceful
woodland setting the frightful thing was to occur which must
come with the passing of the next lion who chanced within
sight or smell of the crumbling arch.

I strove to tear myself loose from my bonds, but succeeded
only in tightening them about my arms.  Then I remained
passive for a long time, letting the scenes of my lifetime
pass in review before my mind's eye.

I tried to imagine the astonishment, incredulity, and horror
with which my family and friends would be overwhelmed if,
for an instant, space could be annihilated and they could
see me at the gates of London.

The gates of London!  Where was the multitude hurrying to
the marts of trade after a night of pleasure or rest?  Where
was the clang of tramcar gongs, the screech of motor horns,
the vast murmur of a dense throng?

Where were they?  And as I asked the question a lone, gaunt
lion strode from the tangled jungle upon the far side of the
clearing.  Majestically and noiselessly upon his padded feet
the king of beasts moved slowly toward the gates of London
and toward me.

Was I afraid?  I fear that I was almost afraid.  I know that
I thought that fear was coming to me, and so I straightened
up and squared my shoulders and looked the lion straight in
the eyes--and waited.

It is not a nice way to die--alone, with one's hands fast
bound, beneath the fangs and talons of a beast of prey.  No,
it is not a nice way to die, not a pretty way.

The lion was halfway across the clearing when I heard a
slight sound behind me.  The great cat stopped in his
tracks.  He lashed his tail against his sides now, instead
of simply twitching its tip, and his low moan became a
thunderous roar.

As I craned my neck to catch a glimpse of the thing that had
aroused the fury of the beast before me, it sprang through
the arched gateway and was at my side--with parted lips and
heaving bosom and disheveled hair--a bronzed and lovely
vision to eyes that had never harbored hope of rescue.

It was Victory, and in her arms she clutched my rifle and
revolver.  A long knife was in the doeskin belt that
supported the doeskin skirt tightly about her lithe limbs.
She dropped my weapons at my feet, and, snatching the knife
from its resting place, severed the bonds that held me.  I
was free, and the lion was preparing to charge.

"Run!" I cried to the girl, as I bent and seized my rifle.
But she only stood there at my side, her bared blade ready
in her hand.

The lion was bounding toward us now in prodigious leaps.  I
raised the rifle and fired.  It was a lucky shot, for I had
no time to aim carefully, and when the beast crumpled and
rolled, lifeless, to the ground, I went upon my knees and
gave thanks to the God of my ancestors.

And, still upon my knees, I turned, and taking the girl's
hand in mine, I kissed it.  She smiled at that, and laid her
other hand upon my head.

"You have strange customs in your country," she said.

I could not but smile at that when I thought how strange it
would seem to my countrymen could they but see me kneeling
there on the site of London, kissing the hand of England's
queen.

"And now," I said, as I rose, "you must return to the safety
of your camp.  I will go with you until you are near enough
to continue alone in safety.  Then I shall try to return to
my comrades."

"I will not return to the camp," she replied.

"But what shall you do?" I asked.

"I do not know.  Only I shall never go back while Buckingham
lives.  I should rather die than go back to him.  Mary came
to me, after they had taken you from the camp, and told me.
I found your strange weapons and followed with them.  It
took me a little longer, for often I had to hide in the
trees that the lions might not get me, but I came in time,
and now you are free to go back to your friends."

"And leave you here?" I exclaimed.

She nodded, but I could see through all her brave front that
she was frightened at the thought.  I could not leave her,
of course, but what in the world I was to do, cumbered with
the care of a young woman, and a queen at that, I was at a
loss to know.  I pointed out that phase of it to her, but
she only shrugged her shapely shoulders and pointed to her
knife.

It was evident that she felt entirely competent to protect
herself.

As we stood there we heard the sound of voices.  They were
coming from the forest through which we had passed when we
had come from camp.

"They are searching for me," said the girl.  "Where shall we
hide?"

I didn't relish hiding.  But when I thought of the
innumerable dangers which surrounded us and the
comparatively small amount of ammunition that I had with me,
I hesitated to provoke a battle with Buckingham and his
warriors when, by flight, I could avoid them and preserve my
cartridges against emergencies which could not be escaped.

"Would they follow us there?" I asked, pointing through the
archway into the Camp of the Lions.

"Never," she replied, "for, in the first place, they would
know that we would not dare go there, and in the second they
themselves would not dare."

"Then we shall take refuge in the Camp of the Lions," I
said.

She shuddered and drew closer to me.

"You dare?" she asked.

"Why not?" I returned.  "We shall be safe from Buckingham,
and you have seen, for the second time in two days, that
lions are harmless before my weapons.  Then, too, I can find
my friends easiest in this direction, for the River Thames
runs through this place you call the Camp of the Lions, and
it is farther down the Thames that my friends are awaiting
me.  Do you not dare come with me?"

"I dare follow wherever you lead," she answered simply.

And so I turned and passed beneath the great arch into the
city of London.



5


As we entered deeper into what had once been the city, the
evidences of man's past occupancy became more frequent.  For
a mile from the arch there was only a riot of weeds and
undergrowth and trees covering small mounds and little
hillocks that, I was sure, were formed of the ruins of
stately buildings of the dead past.

But presently we came upon a district where shattered walls
still raised their crumbling tops in sad silence above the
grass-grown sepulchers of their fallen fellows.  Softened
and mellowed by ancient ivy stood these sentinels of sorrow,
their scarred faces still revealing the rents and gashes of
shrapnel and of bomb.

Contrary to our expectations, we found little indication
that lions in any great numbers laired in this part of
ancient London.  Well-worn pathways, molded by padded paws,
led through the cavernous windows or doorways of a few of
the ruins we passed, and once we saw the savage face of a
great, black-maned lion scowling down upon us from a
shattered stone balcony.

We followed down the bank of the Thames after we came upon
it.  I was anxious to look with my own eyes upon the famous
bridge, and I guessed, too, that the river would lead me
into the part of London where stood Westminster Abbey and
the Tower.

Realizing that the section through which we had been passing
was doubtless outlying, and therefore not so built up with
large structures as the more centrally located part of the
old town, I felt sure that farther down the river I should
find the ruins larger.  The bridge would be there in part,
at least, and so would remain the walls of many of the great
edifices of the past.  There would be no such complete ruin
of large structures as I had seen among the smaller
buildings.

But when I had come to that part of the city which I judged
to have contained the relics I sought I found havoc that had
been wrought there even greater than elsewhere.

At one point upon the bosom of the Thames there rises a few
feet above the water a single, disintegrating mound of
masonry.  Opposite it, upon either bank of the river, are
tumbled piles of ruins overgrown with vegetation.

These, I am forced to believe, are all that remain of London
Bridge, for nowhere else along the river is there any other
slightest sign of pier or abutment.

Rounding the base of a large pile of grass-covered debris,
we came suddenly upon the best preserved ruin we had yet
discovered.  The entire lower story and part of the second
story of what must once have been a splendid public building
rose from a great knoll of shrubbery and trees, while ivy,
thick and luxuriant, clambered upward to the summit of the
broken walls.

In many places the gray stone was still exposed, its
smoothly chiseled face pitted with the scars of battle.  The
massive portal yawned, somber and sorrowful, before us,
giving a glimpse of marble halls within.

The temptation to enter was too great.  I wished to explore
the interior of this one remaining monument of civilization
now dead beyond recall.  Through this same portal, within
these very marble halls, had Gray and Chamberlin and
Kitchener and Shaw, perhaps, come and gone with the other
great ones of the past.

I took Victory's hand in mine.

"Come!" I said.  "I do not know the name by which this great
pile was known, nor the purposes it fulfilled.  It may have
been the palace of your sires, Victory.  From some great
throne within, your forebears may have directed the
destinies of half the world.  Come!"

I must confess to a feeling of awe as we entered the rotunda
of the great building.  Pieces of massive furniture of
another day still stood where man had placed them centuries
ago.  They were littered with dust and broken stone and
plaster, but, otherwise, so perfect was their preservation I
could hardly believe that two centuries had rolled by since
human eyes were last set upon them.

Through one great room after another we wandered, hand in
hand, while Victory asked many questions and for the first
time I began to realize something of the magnificence and
power of the race from whose loins she had sprung.

Splendid tapestries, now mildewed and rotting, hung upon the
walls.  There were mural paintings, too, depicting great
historic events of the past.  For the first time Victory saw
the likeness of a horse, and she was much affected by a huge
oil which depicted some ancient cavalry charge against a
battery of field guns.

In other pictures there were steamships, battleships,
submarines, and quaint looking railway trains--all small and
antiquated in appearance to me, but wonderful to Victory.
She told me that she would like to remain for the rest of
her life where she could look at those pictures daily.

From room to room we passed until presently we emerged into
a mighty chamber, dark and gloomy, for its high and narrow
windows were choked and clogged by ivy.  Along one paneled
wall we groped, our eyes slowly becoming accustomed to the
darkness.  A rank and pungent odor pervaded the atmosphere.

We had made our way about half the distance across one end
of the great apartment when a low growl from the far end
brought us to a startled halt.

Straining my eyes through the gloom, I made out a raised
dais at the extreme opposite end of the hall.  Upon the dais
stood two great chairs, highbacked and with great arms.

The throne of England!  But what were those strange forms
about it?

Victory gave my hand a quick, excited little squeeze.

"The lions!" she whispered.

Yes, lions indeed!  Sprawled about the dais were a dozen
huge forms, while upon the seat of one of the thrones a
small cub lay curled in slumber.

As we stood there for a moment, spellbound by the sight of
those fearsome creatures occupying the very thrones of the
sovereigns of England, the low growl was repeated, and a
great male rose slowly to his feet.

His devilish eyes bored straight through the semi-darkness
toward us.  He had discovered the interloper.  What right
had man within this palace of the beasts? Again he opened
his giant jaws, and this time there rumbled forth a warning
roar.

Instantly eight or ten of the other beasts leaped to their
feet.  Already the great fellow who had spied us was
advancing slowly in our direction.  I held my rifle ready,
but how futile it appeared in the face of this savage horde.

The foremost beast broke into a slow trot, and at his heels
came the others.  All were roaring now, and the din of their
great voices reverberating through the halls and corridors
of the palace formed the most frightful chorus of thunderous
savagery imaginable to the mind of man.

And then the leader charged, and upon the hideous
pandemonium broke the sharp crack of my rifle, once, twice,
thrice.  Three lions rolled, struggling and biting, to the
floor.  Victory seized my arm, with a quick, "This way!
Here is a door," and a moment later we were in a tiny
antechamber at the foot of a narrow stone staircase.

Up this we backed, Victory just behind me, as the first of
the remaining lions leaped from the throne room and sprang
for the stairs.  Again I fired, but others of the ferocious
beasts leaped over their fallen fellows and pursued us.

The stairs were very narrow--that was all that saved us--for
as I backed slowly upward, but a single lion could attack me
at a time, and the carcasses of those I slew impeded the
rushes of the others.

At last we reached the top.  There was a long corridor from
which opened many doorways.  One, directly behind us, was
tight closed.  If we could open it and pass into the chamber
behind we might find a respite from attack.

The remaining lions were roaring horribly.  I saw one
sneaking very slowly up the stairs toward us.

"Try that door," I called to Victory.  "See if it will
open."

She ran up to it and pushed.

"Turn the knob!" I cried, seeing that she did not know how
to open a door, but neither did she know what I meant by
knob.

I put a bullet in the spine of the approaching lion and
leaped to Victory's side.  The door resisted my first
efforts to swing it inward.  Rusted hinges and swollen wood
held it tightly closed.  But at last it gave, and just as
another lion mounted to the top of the stairway it swung in,
and I pushed Victory across the threshold.

Then I turned to meet the renewed attack of the savage foe.
One lion fell in his tracks, another stumbled to my very
feet, and then I leaped within and slammed the portal to.

A quick glance showed me that this was the only door to the
small apartment in which we had found sanctuary, and, with a
sigh of relief, I leaned for a moment against the panels of
the stout barrier that separated us from the ramping demons
without.

Across the room, between two windows, stood a flat-topped
desk.  A little pile of white and brown lay upon it close to
the opposite edge.  After a moment of rest I crossed the
room to investigate.  The white was the bleached human
bones--the skull, collar bones, arms, and a few of the upper
ribs of a man.  The brown was the dust of a decayed military
cap and blouse.  In a chair before the desk were other
bones, while more still strewed the floor beneath the desk
and about the chair.  A man had died sitting there with his
face buried in his arms--two hundred years ago.

Beneath the desk were a pair of spurred military boots,
green and rotten with decay.  In them were the leg bones of
a man.  Among the tiny bones of the hands was an ancient
fountain pen, as good, apparently, as the day it was made,
and a metal covered memoranda book, closed over the bones of
an index finger.

It was a gruesome sight--a pitiful sight--this lone
inhabitant of mighty London.

I picked up the metal covered memoranda book.  Its pages
were rotten and stuck together.  Only here and there was a
sentence or a part of a sentence legible.  The first that I
could read was near the middle of the little volume:

"His majesty left for Tunbridge Wells today, he . . .  jesty
was stricken . . . terday.  God give she does not die . . .
am military governor of Lon . . ."

And farther on:

"It is awful . . . hundred deaths today . . . worse than the
bombardm . . ."

Nearer the end I picked out the following:

"I promised his maj . . . e will find me here when he ret .
. . alone."

The most legible passage was on the next page:

"Thank God we drove them out.  There is not a single . . .
man on British soil today; but at what awful cost.  I tried
to persuade Sir Phillip to urge the people to remain.  But
they are mad with fear of the Death, and rage at our
enemies.  He tells me that the coast cities are packed . . .
waiting to be taken across.  What will become of England,
with none left to rebuild her shattered cities!"

And the last entry:

". . . alone.  Only the wild beasts . . .  A lion is roaring
now beneath the palace windows.  I think the people feared
the beasts even more than they did the Death.  But they are
gone, all gone, and to what?  How much better conditions
will they find on the continent? All gone--only I remain.  I
promised his majesty, and when he returns he will find that
I was true to my trust, for I shall be awaiting him.  God
save the King!"

That was all.  This brave and forever nameless officer died
nobly at his post--true to his country and his king.  It was
the Death, no doubt, that took him.

Some of the entries had been dated.  From the few legible
letters and figures which remained I judge the end came some
time in August, 1937, but of that I am not at all certain.

The diary has cleared up at least one mystery that had
puzzled me not a little, and now I am surprised that I had
not guessed its solution myself--the presence of African and
Asiatic beasts in England.

Acclimated by years of confinement in the zoological
gardens, they were fitted to resume in England the wild
existence for which nature had intended them, and once free,
had evidently bred prolifically, in marked contrast to the
captive exotics of twentieth century Pan-America, which had
gradually become fewer until extinction occurred some time
during the twenty-first century.

The palace, if such it was, lay not far from the banks of
the Thames.  The room in which we were imprisoned overlooked
the river, and I determined to attempt to escape in this
direction.

To descend through the palace was out of the question, but
outside we could discover no lions.  The stems of the ivy
which clambered upward past the window of the room were as
large around as my arm.  I knew that they would support our
weight, and as we could gain nothing by remaining longer in
the palace, I decided to descend by way of the ivy and
follow along down the river in the direction of the launch.

Naturally I was much handicapped by the presence of the
girl.  But I could not abandon her, though I had no idea
what I should do with her after rejoining my companions.
That she would prove a burden and an embarrassment I was
certain, but she had made it equally plain to me that she
would never return to her people to mate with Buckingham.

I owed my life to her, and, all other considerations aside,
that was sufficient demand upon my gratitude and my honor to
necessitate my suffering every inconvenience in her service.
Too, she was queen of England.  But, by far the most potent
argument in her favor, she was a woman in distress--and a
young and very beautiful one.

And so, though I wished a thousand times that she was back
in her camp, I never let her guess it, but did all that lay
within my power to serve and protect her.  I thank God now
that I did so.

With the lions still padding back and forth beyond the
closed door, Victory and I crossed the room to one of the
windows.  I had outlined my plan to her, and she had assured
me that she could descend the ivy without assistance.  In
fact, she smiled a trifle at my question.

Swinging myself outward, I began the descent, and had come
to within a few feet of the ground, being just opposite a
narrow window, when I was startled by a savage growl almost
in my ear, and then a great taloned paw darted from the
aperture to seize me, and I saw the snarling face of a lion
within the embrasure.

Releasing my hold upon the ivy, I dropped the re-maining
distance to the ground, saved from laceration only because
the lion's paw struck the thick stem of ivy.

The creature was making a frightful racket now, leaping back
and forth from the floor at the broad window ledge, tearing
at the masonry with his claws in vain attempts to reach me.
But the opening was too narrow, and the masonry too solid.

Victory had commenced the descent, but I called to her to
stop just above the window, and, as the lion reappeared,
growling and snarling, I put a .33 bullet in his face, and
at the same moment Victory slipped quickly past him,
dropping into my upraised arms that were awaiting her.

The roaring of the beasts that had discovered us, together
with the report of my rifle, had set the balance of the
fierce inmates of the palace into the most frightful uproar
I have ever heard.

I feared that it would not be long before intelligence or
instinct would draw them from the interiors and set them
upon our trail, the river.  Nor had we much more than
reached it when a lion bounded around the corner of the
edifice we had just quitted and stood looking about as
though in search of us.

Following, came others, while Victory and I crouched in
hiding behind a clump of bushes close to the bank of the
river.  The beasts sniffed about the ground for a while, but
they did not chance to go near the spot where we had stood
beneath the window that had given us escape.

Presently a black-maned male raised his head, and, with
cocked ears and glaring eyes, gazed straight at the bush
behind which we lay.  I could have sworn that he had
discovered us, and when he took a few short and stately
steps in our direction I raised my rifle and covered him.
But, after a long, tense moment he looked away, and turned
to glare in another direction.

I breathed a sigh of relief, and so did Victory.  I could
feel her body quiver as she lay pressed close to me, our
cheeks almost touching as we both peered through the same
small opening in the foliage.

I turned to give her a reassuring smile as the lion
indicated that he had not seen us, and as I did so she, too,
turned her face toward mine, for the same purpose,
doubtless.  Anyway, as our heads turned simultaneously, our
lips brushed together.  A startled expression came into
Victory's eyes as she drew back in evident confusion.

As for me, the strangest sensation that I have ever
experienced claimed me for an instant.  A peculiar, tingling
thrill ran through my veins, and my head swam.  I could not
account for it.

Naturally, being a naval officer and consequently in the
best society of the federation, I have seen much of women.
With others, I have laughed at the assertions of the savants
that modern man is a cold and passionless creation in
comparison with the males of former ages--in a word, that
love, as the one grand passion, had ceased to exist.

I do not know, now, but that they were more nearly right
than we have guessed, at least in so far as modern civilized
woman is concerned.  I have kissed many women--young and
beautiful and middle aged and old, and many that I had no
business kissing--but never before had I experienced that
remarkable and altogether delightful thrill that followed
the accidental brushing of my lips against the lips of
Victory.

The occurrence interested me, and I was tempted to
experiment further.  But when I would have essayed it
another new and entirely unaccountable force restrained me.
For the first time in my life I felt embarrassment in the
presence of a woman.

What further might have developed I cannot say, for at that
moment a perfect she-devil of a lioness, with keener eyes
than her lord and master, discovered us.  She came trotting
toward our place of concealment, growling and baring her
yellow fangs.

I waited for an instant, hoping that I might be mistaken,
and that she would turn off in some other direction.  But
no--she increased her trot to a gallop, and then I fired at
her, but the bullet, though it struck her full in the
breast, didn't stop her.

Screaming with pain and rage, the creature fairly flew
toward us.  Behind her came other lions.  Our case looked
hopeless.  We were upon the brink of the river.  There
seemed no avenue of escape, and I knew that even my modern
automatic rifle was inadequate in the face of so many of
these fierce beasts.

To remain where we were would have been suicidal.  We were
both standing now, Victory keeping her place bravely at my
side, when I reached the only decision open to me.

Seizing the girl's hand, I turned, just as the lioness
crashed into the opposite side of the bushes, and, dragging
Victory after me, leaped over the edge of the bank into the
river.

I did not know that lions are not fond of water, nor did I
know if Victory could swim, but death, immediate and
terrible, stared us in the face if we remained, and so I
took the chance.

At this point the current ran close to the shore, so that we
were immediately in deep water, and, to my intense
satisfaction, Victory struck out with a strong, overhand
stroke and set all my fears on her account at rest.

But my relief was short-lived.  That lioness, as I have said
before, was a veritable devil.  She stood for a moment
glaring at us, then like a shot she sprang into the river
and swam swiftly after us.

Victory was a length ahead of me.

"Swim for the other shore!" I called to her.

I was much impeded by my rifle, having to swim with one hand
while I clung to my precious weapon with the other.  The
girl had seen the lioness take to the water, and she had
also seen that I was swimming much more slowly than she, and
what did she do?  She started to drop back to my side.

"Go on!" I cried.  "Make for the other shore, and then
follow down until you find my friends.  Tell them that I
sent you, and with orders that they are to protect you.  Go
on!  Go on!"

But she only waited until we were again swimming side by
side, and I saw that she had drawn her long knife, and was
holding it between her teeth.

"Do as I tell you!" I said to her sharply, but she shook her
head.

The lioness was overhauling us rapidly.  She was swimming
silently, her chin just touching the water, but blood was
streaming from between her lips.  It was evident that her
lungs were pierced.

She was almost upon me.  I saw that in a moment she would
take me under her forepaws, or seize me in those great jaws.
I felt that my time had come, but I meant to die fighting.
And so I turned, and, treading water, raised my rifle above
my head and awaited her.

Victory, animated by a bravery no less ferocious than that
of the dumb beast assailing us, swam straight for me.  It
all happened so swiftly that I cannot recall the details of
the kaleidoscopic action which ensued.  I knew that I rose
high out of the water, and, with clubbed rifle, dealt the
animal a terrific blow upon the skull, that I saw Victory,
her long blade flashing in her hand, close, striking, upon
the beast, that a great paw fell upon her shoulder, and that
I was swept beneath the surface of the water like a straw
before the prow of a freighter.

Still clinging to my rifle, I rose again, to see the lioness
struggling in her death throes but an arm's length from me.
Scarcely had I risen than the beast turned upon her side,
struggled frantically for an instant, and then sank.



6


Victory was nowhere in sight.  Alone, I floated upon the
bosom of the Thames.  In that brief instant I believe that I
suffered more mental anguish than I have crowded into all
the balance of my life before or since.  A few hours before,
I had been wishing that I might be rid of her, and now that
she was gone I would have given my life to have her back
again.

Wearily I turned to swim about the spot where she had
disappeared, hoping that she might rise once at least, and I
would be given the opportunity to save her, and, as I
turned, the water boiled before my face and her head shot up
before me.  I was on the point of striking out to seize her,
when a happy smile illumined her features.

"You are not dead!" she cried.  "I have been searching the
bottom for you.  I was sure that the blow she gave you must
have disabled you," and she glanced about for the lioness.

"She has gone?" she asked.

"Dead," I replied.

"The blow you struck her with the thing you call rifle
stunned her," she explained, "and then I swam in close
enough to get my knife into her heart."

Ah, such a girl!  I could not but wonder what one of our own
Pan-American women would have done under like circumstances.
But then, of course, they have not been trained by stern
necessity to cope with the emergencies and dangers of savage
primeval life.

Along the bank we had just quitted, a score of lions paced
to and fro, growling menacingly.  We could not return, and
we struck out for the opposite shore.  I am a strong
swimmer, and had no doubt as to my ability to cross the
river, but I was not so sure about Victory, so I swam close
behind her, to be ready to give her assistance should she
need it.

She did not, however, reaching the opposite bank as fresh,
apparently, as when she entered the water.  Victory is a
wonder.  Each day that we were together brought new proofs
of it.  Nor was it her courage or vitality only which amazed
me.  She had a head on those shapely shoulders of hers, and
dignity!  My, but she could be regal when she chose!

She told me that the lions were fewer upon this side of the
river, but that there were many wolves, running in great
packs later in the year.  Now they were north somewhere, and
we should have little to fear from them, though we might
meet with a few.

My first concern was to take my weapons apart and dry them,
which was rather difficult in the face of the fact that
every rag about me was drenched.  But finally, thanks to the
sun and much rubbing, I succeeded, though I had no oil to
lubricate them.

We ate some wild berries and roots that Victory found, and
then we set off again down the river, keeping an eye open
for game on one side and the launch on the other, for I
thought that Delcarte, who would be the natural leader
during my absence, might run up the Thames in search of me.

The balance of that day we sought in vain for game or for
the launch, and when night came we lay down, our stomachs
empty, to sleep beneath the stars.  We were entirely
unprotected from attack from wild beasts, and for this
reason I remained awake most of the night, on guard.  But
nothing approached us, though I could hear the lions roaring
across the river, and once I thought I heard the howl of a
beast north of us--it might have been a wolf.

Altogether, it was a most unpleasant night, and I determined
then that if we were forced to sleep out again that I should
provide some sort of shelter which would protect us from
attack while we slept.

Toward morning I dozed, and the sun was well up when Victory
aroused me by gently shaking my shoulder.

"Antelope!" she whispered in my ear, and, as I raised my
head, she pointed up-river.  Crawling to my knees, I looked
in the direction she indicated, to see a buck standing upon
a little knoll some two hundred yards from us.  There was
good cover between the animal and me, and so, though I might
have hit him at two hundred yards, I preferred to crawl
closer to him and make sure of the meat we both so craved.

I had covered about fifty yards of the distance, and the
beast was still feeding peacefully, so I thought that I
would make even surer of a hit by going ahead another fifty
yards, when the animal suddenly raised his head and looked
away, up-river.  His whole attitude proclaimed that he was
startled by something beyond him that I could not see.

Realizing that he might break and run and that I should then
probably miss him entirely, I raised my rifle to my
shoulder.  But even as I did so the animal leaped into the
air, and simultaneously there was a sound of a shot from
beyond the knoll.

For an instant I was dumbfounded.  Had the report come from
down-river, I should have instantly thought that one of my
own men had fired.  But coming from up-river it puzzled me
considerably.  Who could there be with firearms in primitive
England other than we of the Coldwater?

Victory was directly behind me, and I motioned for her to
lie down, as I did, behind the bush from which I had been
upon the point of firing at the antelope.  We could see that
the buck was quite dead, and from our hiding place we waited
to discover the identity of his slayer when the latter
should approach and claim his kill.

We had not long to wait, and when I saw the head and
shoulders of a man appear above the crest of the knoll, I
sprang to my feet, with a heartfelt cry of joy, for it was
Delcarte.

At the sound of my voice, Delcarte half raised his rifle in
readiness for the attack of an enemy, but a moment later he
recognized me, and was coming rapidly to meet us.  Behind
him was Snider.  They both were astounded to see me upon the
north bank of the river, and much more so at the sight of my
companion.

Then I introduced them to Victory, and told them that she
was queen of England.  They thought, at first, that I was
joking.  But when I had recounted my adventures and they
realized that I was in earnest, they believed me.

They told me that they had followed me inshore when I had
not returned from the hunt, that they had met the men of the
elephant country, and had had a short and one-sided battle
with the fellows.  And that afterward they had returned to
the launch with a prisoner, from whom they had learned that
I had probably been captured by the men of the lion country.

With the prisoner as a guide they had set off up-river in
search of me, but had been much delayed by motor trouble,
and had finally camped after dark a half mile above the spot
where Victory and I had spent the night.  They must have
passed us in the dark, and why I did not hear the sound of
the propeller I do not know, unless it passed me at a time
when the lions were making an unusually earsplitting din
upon the opposite side.

Taking the antelope with us, we all returned to the launch,
where we found Taylor as delighted to see me alive again as
Delcarte had been.  I cannot say truthfully that Snider
evinced much enthusiasm at my rescue.

Taylor had found the ingredients for chemical fuel, and the
distilling of them had, with the motor trouble, accounted
for their delay in setting out after me.

The prisoner that Delcarte and Snider had taken was a
powerful young fellow from the elephant country.
Notwithstanding the fact that they had all assured him to
the contrary, he still could not believe that we would not
kill him.

He assured us that his name was Thirty-six, and, as he could
not count above ten, I am sure that he had no conception of
the correct meaning of the word, and that it may have been
handed down to him either from the military number of an
ancestor who had served in the English ranks during the
Great War, or that originally it was the number of some
famous regiment with which a forbear fought.

Now that we were reunited, we held a council to determine
what course we should pursue in the immediate future.
Snider was still for setting out to sea and returning to
Pan-America, but the better judgment of Delcarte and Taylor
ridiculed the suggestion--we should not have lived a
fortnight.

To remain in England, constantly menaced by wild beasts and
men equally as wild, seemed about as bad.  I suggested that
we cross the Channel and ascertain if we could not discover
a more enlightened and civilized people upon the continent.
I was sure that some trace of the ancient culture and
greatness of Europe must remain.  Germany, probably, would
be much as it was during the twentieth century, for, in
common with most Pan-Americans, I was positive that Germany
had been victorious in the Great War.

Snider demurred at the suggestion.  He said that it was bad
enough to have come this far.  He did not want to make it
worse by going to the continent.  The outcome of it was that
I finally lost my patience, and told him that from then on
he would do what I thought best--that I proposed to assume
command of the party, and that they might all consider
themselves under my orders, as much so as though we were
still aboard the Coldwater and in Pan-American waters.

Delcarte and Taylor immediately assured me that they had not
for an instant assumed anything different, and that they
were as ready to follow and obey me here as they would be
upon the other side of thirty.

Snider said nothing, but he wore a sullen scowl.  And I
wished then, as I had before, and as I did to a much greater
extent later, that fate had not decreed that he should have
chanced to be a member of the launch's party upon that
memorable day when last we quitted the Coldwater.

Victory, who was given a voice in our councils, was all for
going to the continent, or anywhere else, in fact, where she
might see new sights and experience new adventures.

"Afterward we can come back to Grabritin," she said, "and if
Buckingham is not dead and we can catch him away from his
men and kill him, then I can return to my people, and we can
all live in peace and happiness."

She spoke of killing Buckingham with no greater concern than
one might evince in the contemplated destruction of a sheep;
yet she was neither cruel nor vindictive.  In fact, Victory
is a very sweet and womanly woman.  But human life is of
small account beyond thirty--a legacy from the bloody days
when thousands of men perished in the trenches between the
rising and the setting of a sun, when they laid them
lengthwise in these same trenches and sprinkled dirt over
them, when the Germans corded their corpses like wood and
set fire to them, when women and children and old men were
butchered, and great passenger ships were torpedoed without
warning.

Thirty-six, finally assured that we did not intend slaying
him, was as keen to accompany us as was Victory.

The crossing to the continent was uneventful, its monotony
being relieved, however, by the childish delight of Victory
and Thirty-six in the novel experience of riding safely upon
the bosom of the water, and of being so far from land.

With the possible exception of Snider, the little party
appeared in the best of spirits, laughing and joking, or
interestedly discussing the possibilities which the future
held for us: what we should find upon the continent, and
whether the inhabitants would be civilized or barbarian
peoples.

Victory asked me to explain the difference between the two,
and when I had tried to do so as clearly as possible, she
broke into a gay little laugh.

"Oh," she cried, "then I am a barbarian!"

I could not but laugh, too, as I admitted that she was,
indeed, a barbarian.  She was not offended, taking the
matter as a huge joke.  But some time thereafter she sat in
silence, apparently deep in thought.  Finally she looked up
at me, her strong white teeth gleaming behind her smiling
lips.

"Should you take that thing you call 'razor,'" she said,
"and cut the hair from the face of Thirty-six, and exchange
garments with him, you would be the barbarian and Thirty-six
the civilized man.  There is no other difference between
you, except your weapons.  Clothe you in a wolfskin, give
you a knife and a spear, and set you down in the woods of
Grabritin--of what service would your civilization be to
you?"

Delcarte and Taylor smiled at her reply, but Thirty-six and
Snider laughed uproariously.  I was not surprised at Thirty-
six, but I thought that Snider laughed louder than the
occasion warranted.  As a matter of fact, Snider, it seemed
to me, was taking advantage of every opportunity, however
slight, to show insubordination, and I determined then that
at the first real breach of discipline I should take action
that would remind Snider, ever after, that I was still his
commanding officer.

I could not help but notice that his eyes were much upon
Victory, and I did not like it, for I knew the type of man
he was.  But as it would not be necessary ever to leave the
girl alone with him I felt no apprehension for her safety.

After the incident of the discussion of barbarians I thought
that Victory's manner toward me changed perceptibly.  She
held aloof from me, and when Snider took his turn at the
wheel, sat beside him, upon the pretext that she wished to
learn how to steer the launch.  I wondered if she had
guessed the man's antipathy for me, and was seeking his
company solely for the purpose of piquing me.

Snider was, too, taking full advantage of his opportunity.
Often he leaned toward the girl to whisper in her ear, and
he laughed much, which was unusual with Snider.

Of course, it was nothing at all to me; yet, for some
unaccountable reason, the sight of the two of them sitting
there so close to one another and seeming to be enjoying
each other's society to such a degree irritated me
tremendously, and put me in such a bad humor that I took no
pleasure whatsoever in the last few hours of the crossing.

We aimed to land near the site of ancient Ostend.  But when
we neared the coast we discovered no indication of any human
habitations whatever, let alone a city.  After we had
landed, we found the same howling wilderness about us that
we had discovered on the British Isle.  There was no
slightest indication that civilized man had ever set a foot
upon that portion of the continent of Europe.

Although I had feared as much, since our experience in
England, I could not but own to a feeling of marked
disappointment, and to the gravest fears of the future,
which induced a mental depression that was in no way
dissipated by the continued familiarity between Victory and
Snider.

I was angry with myself that I permitted that matter to
affect me as it had.  I did not wish to admit to myself that
I was angry with this uncultured little savage, that it made
the slightest difference to me what she did or what she did
not do, or that I could so lower myself as to feel personal
enmity towards a common sailor.  And yet, to be honest, I
was doing both.

Finding nothing to detain us about the spot where Ostend
once had stood, we set out up the coast in search of the
mouth of the River Rhine, which I purposed ascending in
search of civilized man.  It was my intention to explore the
Rhine as far up as the launch would take us.  If we found no
civilization there we would return to the North Sea,
continue up the coast to the Elbe, and follow that river and
the canals of Berlin.  Here, at least, I was sure that we
should find what we sought--and, if not, then all Europe had
reverted to barbarism.

The weather remained fine, and we made excellent progress,
but everywhere along the Rhine we met with the same
disappointment--no sign of civilized man, in fact, no sign
of man at all.

I was not enjoying the exploration of modern Europe as I had
anticipated--I was unhappy.  Victory seemed changed, too.  I
had enjoyed her company at first, but since the trip across
the Channel I had held aloof from her.

Her chin was in the air most of the time, and yet I rather
think that she regretted her friendliness with Snider, for I
noticed that she avoided him entirely.  He, on the contrary,
emboldened by her former friendliness, sought every
opportunity to be near her.  I should have liked nothing
better than a reasonably good excuse to punch his head; yet,
paradoxically, I was ashamed of myself for harboring him any
ill will.  I realized that there was something the matter
with me, but I did not know what it was.

Matters remained thus for several days, and we continued our
journey up the Rhine.  At Cologne, I had hoped to find some
reassuring indications, but there was no Cologne.  And as
there had been no other cities along the river up to that
point, the devastation was infinitely greater than time
alone could have wrought.  Great guns, bombs, and mines must
have leveled every building that man had raised, and then
nature, unhindered, had covered the ghastly evidence of
human depravity with her beauteous mantle of verdure.
Splendid trees reared their stately tops where splendid
cathedrals once had reared their domes, and sweet wild
flowers blossomed in simple serenity in soil that once was
drenched with human blood.

Nature had reclaimed what man had once stolen from her and
defiled.  A herd of zebras grazed where once the German
kaiser may have reviewed his troops.  An antelope rested
peacefully in a bed of daisies where, perhaps, two hundred
years ago a big gun belched its terror-laden messages of
death, of hate, of destruction against the works of man and
God alike.

We were in need of fresh meat, yet I hesitated to shatter
the quiet and peaceful serenity of the view with the crack
of a rifle and the death of one of those beautiful creatures
before us.  But it had to be done--we must eat.  I left the
work to Delcarte, however, and in a moment we had two
antelope and the landscape to ourselves.

After eating, we boarded the launch and continued up the
river.  For two days we passed through a primeval
wilderness.  In the afternoon of the second day we landed
upon the west bank of the river, and, leaving Snider and
Thirty-six to guard Victory and the launch, Delcarte,
Taylor, and I set out after game.

We tramped away from the river for upwards of an hour before
discovering anything, and then only a small red deer, which
Taylor brought down with a neat shot of two hundred yards.
It was getting too late to proceed farther, so we rigged a
sling, and the two men carried the deer back toward the
launch while I walked a hundred yards ahead, in the hope of
bagging something further for our larder.

We had covered about half the distance to the river, when I
suddenly came face to face with a man.  He was as primitive
and uncouth in appearance as the Grabritins--a shaggy,
unkempt savage, clothed in a shirt of skin cured with the
head on, the latter surmounting his own head to form a
bonnet, and giving to him a most fearful and ferocious
aspect.

The fellow was armed with a long spear and a club, the
latter dangling down his back from a leathern thong about
his neck.  His feet were incased in hide sandals.

At sight of me, he halted for an instant, then turned and
dove into the forest, and, though I called reassuringly to
him in English he did not return nor did I again see him.

The sight of the wild man raised my hopes once more that
elsewhere we might find men in a higher state of
civilization--it was the society of civilized man that I
craved--and so, with a lighter heart, I continued on toward
the river and the launch.

I was still some distance ahead of Delcarte and Taylor, when
I came in sight of the Rhine again.  But I came to the
water's edge before I noticed that anything was amiss with
the party we had left there a few hours before.

My first intimation of disaster was the absence of the
launch from its former moorings.  And then, a moment later--
I discovered the body of a man lying upon the bank.  Running
toward it, I saw that it was Thirty-six, and as I stopped
and raised the Grabritin's head in my arms, I heard a faint
moan break from his lips.  He was not dead, but that he was
badly injured was all too evident.

Delcarte and Taylor came up a moment later, and the three of
us worked over the fellow, hoping to revive him that he
might tell us what had happened, and what had become of the
others.  My first thought was prompted by the sight I had
recently had of the savage native.  The little party had
evidently been surprised, and in the attack Thirty-six had
been wounded and the others taken prisoners.  The thought
was almost like a physical blow in the face--it stunned me.
Victory in the hands of these abysmal brutes!  It was
frightful.  I almost shook poor Thirty-six in my efforts to
revive him.

I explained my theory to the others, and then Delcarte
shattered it by a single movement of the hand.  He drew
aside the lion's skin that covered half of the Grabritin's
breast, revealing a neat, round hole in Thirty-six's chest--
a hole that could have been made by no other weapon than a
rifle.

"Snider!" I exclaimed.  Delcarte nodded.  At about the same
time the eyelids of the wounded man fluttered, and raised.
He looked up at us, and very slowly the light of
consciousness returned to his eyes.

"What happened, Thirty-six?" I asked him.

He tried to reply, but the effort caused him to cough,
bringing about a hemorrhage of the lungs and again he fell
back exhausted.  For several long minutes he lay as one
dead, then in an almost inaudible whisper he spoke.

"Snider--"  He paused, tried to speak again, raised a hand,
and pointed down-river.  "They--went--back," and then he
shuddered convulsively and died.

None of us voiced his belief.  But I think they were all
alike: Victory and Snider had stolen the launch, and
deserted us.



7


We stood there, grouped about the body of the dead
Grabritin, looking futilely down the river to where it made
an abrupt curve to the west, a quarter of a mile below us,
and was lost to sight, as though we expected to see the
truant returning to us with our precious launch--the thing
that meant life or death to us in this unfriendly, savage
world.

I felt, rather than saw, Taylor turn his eyes slowly toward
my profile, and, as mine swung to meet them, the expression
upon his face recalled me to my duty and responsibility as
an officer.

The utter hopelessness that was reflected in his face must
have been the counterpart of what I myself felt, but in that
brief instant I determined to hide my own misgivings that I
might bolster up the courage of the others.

"We are lost!" was written as plainly upon Taylor's face as
though his features were the printed words upon an open
book.  He was thinking of the launch, and of the launch
alone.  Was I?  I tried to think that I was.  But a greater
grief than the loss of the launch could have engendered in
me, filled my heart--a sullen, gnawing misery which I tried
to deny--which I refused to admit--but which persisted in
obsessing me until my heart rose and filled my throat, and I
could not speak when I would have uttered words of
reassurance to my companions.

And then rage came to my relief--rage against the vile
traitor who had deserted three of his fellow countrymen in
so frightful a position.  I tried to feel an equal rage
against the woman, but somehow I could not, and kept
searching for excuses for her--her youth, her inexperience,
her savagery.

My rising anger swept away my temporary helplessness.  I
smiled, and told Taylor not to look so glum.

"We will follow them," I said, "and the chances are that we
shall overtake them.  They will not travel as rapidly as
Snider probably hopes.  He will be forced to halt for fuel
and for food, and the launch must follow the windings of the
river; we can take short cuts while they are traversing the
detour.  I have my map--thank God! I always carry it upon my
person--and with that and the compass we will have an
advantage over them."

My words seemed to cheer them both, and they were for
starting off at once in pursuit.  There was no reason why we
should delay, and we set forth down the river.  As we
tramped along, we discussed a question that was uppermost in
the mind of each--what we should do with Snider when we had
captured him, for with the action of pursuit had come the
optimistic conviction that we should succeed.  As a matter
of fact, we had to succeed.  The very thought of remaining
in this utter wilderness for the rest of our lives was
impossible.

We arrived at nothing very definite in the matter of
Snider's punishment, since Taylor was for shooting him,
Delcarte insisting that he should be hanged, while I,
although fully conscious of the gravity of his offense,
could not bring myself to give the death penalty.

I fell to wondering what charm Victory had found in such a
man as Snider, and why I insisted upon finding excuses for
her and trying to defend her indefensible act.  She was
nothing to me.  Aside from the natural gratitude I felt for
her since she had saved my life, I owed her nothing.  She
was a half-naked little savage--I, a gentleman, and an
officer in the world's greatest navy.  There could be no
close bonds of interest between us.

This line of reflection I discovered to be as distressing as
the former, but, though I tried to turn my mind to other
things, it persisted in returning to the vision of an oval
face, sun-tanned; of smiling lips, revealing white and even
teeth; of brave eyes that harbored no shadow of guile; and
of a tumbling mass of wavy hair that crowned the loveliest
picture on which my eyes had ever rested.

Every time this vision presented itself I felt myself turn
cold with rage and hate against Snider.  I could forgive the
launch, but if he had wronged her he should die--he should
die at my own hands; in this I was determined.

For two days we followed the river northward, cutting off
where we could, but confined for the most part to the game
trails that paralleled the stream.  One afternoon, we cut
across a narrow neck of land that saved us many miles, where
the river wound to the west and back again.

Here we decided to halt, for we had had a hard day of it,
and, if the truth were known, I think that we had all given
up hope of overtaking the launch other than by the merest
accident.

We had shot a deer just before our halt, and, as Taylor and
Delcarte were preparing it, I walked down to the water to
fill our canteens.  I had just finished, and was
straightening up, when something floating around a bend
above me caught my eye.  For a moment I could not believe
the testimony of my own senses.  It was a boat.

I shouted to Delcarte and Taylor, who came running to my
side.

"The launch!" cried Delcarte; and, indeed, it was the
launch, floating down-river from above us.  Where had it
been?  How had we passed it?  And how were we to reach it
now, should Snider and the girl discover us?

"It's drifting," said Taylor.  "I see no one in it."

I was stripping off my clothes, and Delcarte soon followed
my example.  I told Taylor to remain on shore with the
clothing and rifles.  He might also serve us better there,
since it would give him an opportunity to take a shot at
Snider should the man discover us and show himself.

With powerful strokes we swam out in the path of the
oncoming launch.  Being a stronger swimmer than Delcarte, I
soon was far in the lead, reaching the center of the channel
just as the launch bore down upon me.  It was drifting
broadside on.  I seized the gunwale and raised myself
quickly, so that my chin topped the side.  I expected a blow
the moment that I came within the view of the occupants, but
no blow fell.

Snider lay upon his back in the bottom of the boat alone.
Even before I had clambered in and stooped above him I knew
that he was dead.  Without examining him further, I ran
forward to the control board and pressed the starting
button.  To my relief, the mechanism responded--the launch
was uninjured.  Coming about, I picked up Delcarte.  He was
astounded at the sight that met his eyes, and immediately
fell to examining Snider's body for signs of life or an
explanation of the manner in which he met his death.

The fellow had been dead for hours--he was cold and still.
But Delcarte's search was not without results, for above
Snider's heart was a wound, a slit about an inch in length--
such a slit as a sharp knife would make, and in the dead
fingers of one hand was clutched a strand of long brown
hair--Victory's hair was brown.

They say that dead men tell no tales, but Snider told the
story of his end as clearly as though the dead lips had
parted and poured forth the truth.  The beast had attacked
the girl, and she had defended her honor.

We buried Snider beside the Rhine, and no stone marks his
last resting place.  Beasts do not require headstones.

Then we set out in the launch, turning her nose upstream.
When I had told Delcarte and Taylor that I intended
searching for the girl, neither had demurred.

"We had her wrong in our thoughts," said Delcarte, "and the
least that we can do in expiation is to find and rescue
her."

We called her name aloud every few minutes as we motored up
the river, but, though we returned all the way to our former
camping place, we did not find her.  I then decided to
retrace our journey, letting Taylor handle the launch, while
Delcarte and I, upon opposite sides of the river, searched
for some sign of the spot where Victory had landed.

We found nothing until we had reached a point a few miles
above the spot where I had first seen the launch drifting
down toward us, and there I discovered the remnants of a
recent camp fire.

That Victory carried flint and steel I was aware, and that
it was she who built the fire I was positive.  But which way
had she gone since she stopped here?

Would she go on down the river, that she might thus bring
herself nearer her own Grabritin, or would she have sought
to search for us upstream, where she had seen us last?

I had hailed Taylor, and sent him across the river to take
in Delcarte, that the two might join me and discuss my
discovery and our future plans.

While waiting for them, I stood looking out over the river,
my back toward the woods that stretched away to the east
behind me.  Delcarte was just stepping into the launch upon
the opposite side of the stream, when, without the least
warning, I was violently seized by both arms and about the
waist--three or four men were upon me at once; my rifle was
snatched from my hands and my revolver from my belt.

I struggled for an instant, but finding my efforts of no
avail, I ceased them, and turned my head to have a look at
my assailants.  At the same time several others of them
walked around in front of me, and, to my astonishment, I
found myself looking upon uniformed soldiery, armed with
rifles, revolvers, and sabers, but with faces as black as
coal.

Delcorte and Taylor were now in mis-stream, coming toward
us, and I called to them to keep aloof until I knew whether
the intentions of my captors were friendly or otherwise.  My
good men wanted to come on and annihilate the blacks.  But
there were upward of a hundred of the latter, all well
armed, and so I commanded Delcarte to keep out of harm's
way, and stay where he was till I needed him.

A young officer called and beckoned to them.  But they
refused to come, and so he gave orders that resulted in my
hands being secured at my back, after which the company
marched away, straight toward the east.

I noticed that the men wore spurs, which seemed strange to
me.  But when, late in the afternoon, we arrived at their
encampment, I discovered that my captors were cavalrymen.

In the center of a plain stood a log fort, with a block-
house at each of its four corners.  As we approached, I saw
a herd of cavalry horses grazing under guard outside the
walls of the post.  They were small, stocky horses, but the
telltale saddle galls proclaimed their calling.  The flag
flying from a tall staff inside the palisade was one which I
had never before seen nor heard of.

We marched directly into the compound, where the company was
dismissed, with the exception of a guard of four privates,
who escorted me in the wake of the young officer.  The
latter led us across a small parade ground, where a battery
of light field guns was parked, and toward a log building,
in front of which rose the flagstaff.

I was escorted within the building into the presence of an
old negro, a fine looking man, with a dignified and military
bearing.  He was a colonel, I was to learn later, and to him
I owe the very humane treatment that was accorded me while I
remained his prisoner.

He listened to the report of his junior, and then turned to
question me, but with no better results than the former had
accomplished.  Then he summoned an orderly, and gave some
instructions.  The soldier saluted, and left the room,
returning in about five minutes with a hairy old white man--
just such a savage, primeval-looking fellow as I had
discovered in the woods the day that Snider had disappeared
with the launch.

The colonel evidently expected to use the fellow as
interpreter, but when the savage addressed me it was in a
language as foreign to me as was that of the blacks.  At
last the old officer gave it up, and, shaking his head, gave
instructions for my removal.

From his office I was led to a guardhouse, in which I found
about fifty half-naked whites, clad in the skins of wild
beasts.  I tried to converse with them, but not one of them
could understand Pan-American, nor could I make head or tail
of their jargon.

For over a month I remained a prisoner there, working from
morning until night at odd jobs about the headquarters
building of the commanding officer.  The other prisoners
worked harder than I did, and I owe my better treatment
solely to the kindliness and discrimination of the old
colonel.

What had become of Victory, of Delcarte, of Taylor I could
not know; nor did it seem likely that I should ever learn.
I was most depressed.  But I whiled away my time in
performing the duties given me to the best of my ability and
attempting to learn the language of my captors.

Who they were or where they came from was a mystery to me.
That they were the outpost of some pow-erful black nation
seemed likely, yet where the seat of that nation lay I could
not guess.

They looked upon the whites as their inferiors, and treated
us accordingly.  They had a literature of their own, and
many of the men, even the common soldiers, were omnivorous
readers.  Every two weeks a dust-covered trooper would trot
his jaded mount into the post and deliver a bulging sack of
mail at headquarters.  The next day he would be away again
upon a fresh horse toward the south, carrying the soldiers'
letters to friends in the far off land of mystery from
whence they all had come.

Troops, sometimes mounted and sometimes afoot, left the post
daily for what I assumed to be patrol duty.  I judged the
little force of a thousand men were detailed here to
maintain the authority of a distant government in a
conquered country.  Later, I learned that my surmise was
correct, and this was but one of a great chain of similar
posts that dotted the new frontier of the black nation into
whose hands I had fallen.

Slowly I learned their tongue, so that I could understand
what was said before me, and make myself understood.  I had
seen from the first that I was being treated as a slave--
that all whites that fell into the hands of the blacks were
thus treated.

Almost daily new prisoners were brought in, and about three
weeks after I was brought in to the post a troop of cavalry
came from the south to relieve one of the troops stationed
there.  There was great jubilation in the encampment after
the arrival of the newcomers, old friendships were renewed
and new ones made.  But the happiest men were those of the
troop that was to be relieved.

The next morning they started away, and as they were forced
upon the parade ground we prisoners were marched from our
quarters and lined up before them.  A couple of long chains
were brought, with rings in the links every few feet.  At
first I could not guess the purpose of these chains.  But I
was soon to learn.

A couple of soldiers snapped the first ring around the neck
of a powerful white slave, and one by one the rest of us
were herded to our places, and the work of shackling us neck
to neck commenced.

The colonel stood watching the procedure.  Presently his
eyes fell upon me, and he spoke to a young officer at his
side.  The latter stepped toward me and motioned me to
follow him.  I did so, and was led back to the colonel.

By this time I could understand a few words of their strange
language, and when the colonel asked me if I would prefer to
remain at the post as his body servant, I signified my
willingness as emphatically as possible, for I had seen
enough of the brutality of the common soldiers toward their
white slaves to have no desire to start out upon a march of
unknown length, chained by the neck, and driven on by the
great whips that a score of the soldiers carried to
accelerate the speed of their charges.

About three hundred prisoners who had been housed in six
prisons at the post marched out of the gates that morning,
toward what fate and what future I could not guess.  Neither
had the poor devils themselves more than the most vague
conception of what lay in store for them, except that they
were going elsewhere to continue in the slavery that they
had known since their capture by their black conquerors--a
slavery that was to continue until death released them.

My position was altered at the post.  From working about the
headquarters office, I was transferred to the colonel's
living quarters.  I had greater freedom, and no longer slept
in one of the prisons, but had a little room to myself off
the kitchen of the colonel's log house.

My master was always kind to me, and under him I rapidly
learned the language of my captors, and much concerning them
that had been a mystery to me before.  His name was Abu
Belik.  He was a colonel in the cavalry of Abyssinia, a
country of which I do not remember ever hearing, but which
Colonel Belik assured me is the oldest civilized country in
the world.

Colonel Belik was born in Adis Abeba, the capital of the
empire, and until recently had been in command of the
emperor's palace guard.  Jealousy and the ambition and
intrigue of another officer had lost him the favor of his
emperor, and he had been detailed to this frontier post as a
mark of his sovereign's displeasure.

Some fifty years before, the young emperor, Menelek XIV, was
ambitious.  He knew that a great world lay across the waters
far to the north of his capital.  Once he had crossed the
desert and looked out upon the blue sea that was the
northern boundary of his dominions.

There lay another world to conquer.  Menelek busied himself
with the building of a great fleet, though his people were
not a maritime race.  His army crossed into Europe.  It met
with little resistance, and for fifty years his soldiers had
been pushing his boundaries farther and farther toward the
north.

"The yellow men from the east and north are contesting our
rights here now," said the colonel, "but we shall win--we
shall conquer the world, carrying Christianity to all the
benighted heathen of Europe, and Asia as well."

"You are a Christian people?" I asked.

He looked at me in surprise, nodding his head affirmatively.

"I am a Christian," I said.  "My people are the most
powerful on earth."

He smiled, and shook his head indulgently, as a father to a
child who sets up his childish judgment against that of his
elders.

Then I set out to prove my point.  I told him of our cities,
of our army, of our great navy.  He came right back at me
asking for figures, and when he was done I had to admit that
only in our navy were we numerically superior.

Menelek XIV is the undisputed ruler of all the continent of
Africa, of all of ancient Europe except the British Isles,
Scandinavia, and eastern Russia, and has large possessions
and prosperous colonies in what once were Arabia and Turkey
in Asia.

He has a standing army of ten million men, and his people
possess slaves--white slaves--to the number of ten or
fifteen million.

Colonel Belik was much surprised, however, upon his part to
learn of the great nation which lay across the ocean, and
when he found that I was a naval officer, he was inclined to
accord me even greater consideration than formerly.  It was
difficult for him to believe my assertion that there were
but few blacks in my country, and that these occupied a
lower social plane than the whites.

Just the reverse is true in Colonel Belik's land.  He
considered whites inferior beings, creatures of a lower
order, and assuring me that even the few white freemen of
Abyssinia were never accorded anything approximating a
position of social equality with the blacks.  They live in
the poorer districts of the cities, in little white
colonies, and a black who marries a white is socially
ostracized.

The arms and ammunition of the Abyssinians are greatly
inferior to ours, yet they are tremendously effective
against the ill-armed barbarians of Europe.  Their rifles
are of a type similar to the magazine rifles of twentieth
century Pan-America, but carrying only five cartridges in
the magazine, in addition to the one in the chamber.  They
are of extraordinary length, even those of the cavalry, and
are of extreme accuracy.

The Abyssinians themselves are a fine looking race of black
men--tall, muscular, with fine teeth, and regular features,
which incline distinctly toward Semitic mold--I refer to the
full-blooded natives of Abyssinia.  They are the patricians--
the aristocracy.  The army is officered almost exclusively
by them.  Among the soldiery a lower type of negro
predominates, with thicker lips and broader, flatter noses.
These men are recruited, so the colonel told me, from among
the conquered tribes of Africa.  They are good soldiers--
brave and loyal.  They can read and write, and they are
endowed with a self-confidence and pride which, from my
readings of the words of ancient African explorers, must
have been wanting in their earliest progenitors.  On the
whole, it is apparent that the black race has thrived far
better in the past two centuries under men of its own color
than it had under the domination of whites during all
previous history.

I had been a prisoner at the little frontier post for over a
month, when orders came to Colonel Belik to hasten to the
eastern frontier with the major portion of his command,
leaving only one troop to garrison the fort.  As his body
servant, I accompanied him mounted upon a fiery little
Abyssinian pony.

We marched rapidly for ten days through the heart of the
ancient German empire, halting when night found us in
proximity to water.  Often we passed small posts similar to
that at which the colonel's regiment had been quartered,
finding in each instance that only a single company or troop
remained for defence, the balance having been withdrawn
toward the northeast, in the same direction in which we were
moving.

Naturally, the colonel had not confided to me the nature of
his orders.  But the rapidity of our march and the fact that
all available troops were being hastened toward the
northeast assured me that a matter of vital importance to
the dominion of Menelek XIV in that part of Europe was
threatening or had already broken.

I could not believe that a simple rising of the savage
tribes of whites would necessitate the mobilizing of such a
force as we presently met with converging from the south
into our trail.  There were large bodies of cavalry and
infantry, endless streams of artillery wagons and guns, and
countless horse-drawn covered vehicles laden with camp
equipage, munitions, and provisions.

Here, for the first time, I saw camels, great caravans of
them, bearing all sorts of heavy burdens, and miles upon
miles of elephants doing similar service.  It was a scene of
wondrous and barbaric splendor, for the men and beasts from
the south were gaily caparisoned in rich colors, in marked
contrast to the gray uniformed forces of the frontier, with
which I had been familiar.

The rumor reached us that Menelek himself was coming, and
the pitch of excitement to which this announcement raised
the troops was little short of miraculous--at least, to one
of my race and nationality whose rulers for centuries had
been but ordinary men, holding office at the will of the
people for a few brief years.

As I witnessed it, I could not but speculate upon the moral
effect upon his troops of a sovereign's presence in the
midst of battle.  All else being equal in war between the
troops of a republic and an empire, could not this
exhilarated mental state, amounting almost to hysteria on
the part of the imperial troops, weigh heavily against the
soldiers of a president?  I wonder.

But if the emperor chanced to be absent?  What then? Again I
wonder.

On the eleventh day we reached our destination--a walled
frontier city of about twenty thousand.  We passed some
lakes, and crossed some old canals before entering the
gates.  Within, beside the frame buildings, were many built
of ancient brick and well-cut stone.  These, I was told,
were of material taken from the ruins of the ancient city
which, once, had stood upon the site of the present town.

The name of the town, translated from the Abyssinian, is New
Gondar.  It stands, I am convinced, upon the ruins of
ancient Berlin, the one time capital of the old German
empire, but except for the old building material used in the
new town there is no sign of the former city.

The day after we arrived, the town was gaily decorated with
flags, streamers, gorgeous rugs, and banners, for the rumor
had proved true--the emperor was coming.

Colonel Belik had accorded me the greatest liberty,
permitting me to go where I pleased, after my few duties had
been performed.  As a result of his kindness, I spent much
time wandering about New Gondar, talking with the
inhabitants, and exploring the city of black men.

As I had been given a semi-military uniform which bore
insignia indicating that I was an officer's body servant,
even the blacks treated me with a species of respect, though
I could see by their manner that I was really as the dirt
beneath their feet.  They answered my questions civilly
enough, but they would not enter into conversation with me.
It was from other slaves that I learned the gossip of the
city.

Troops were pouring in from the west and south, and pouring
out toward the east.  I asked an old slave who was sweeping
the dirt into little piles in the gutters of the street
where the soldiers were going.  He looked at me in surprise.

"Why, to fight the yellow men, of course," he said.  "They
have crossed the border, and are marching toward New
Gondar."

"Who will win?" I asked.

He shrugged his shoulders.  "Who knows?" he said.  "I hope
it will be the yellow men, but Menelek is powerful--it will
take many yellow men to defeat him."

Crowds were gathering along the sidewalks to view the
emperor's entry into the city.  I took my place among them,
although I hate crowds, and I am glad that I did, for I
witnessed such a spectacle of barbaric splendor as no other
Pan-American has ever looked upon.

Down the broad main thoroughfare, which may once have been
the historic Unter den Linden, came a brilliant cortege.  At
the head rode a regiment of red-coated hussars--enormous
men, black as night.  There were troops of riflemen mounted
on camels.  The emperor rode in a golden howdah upon the
back of a huge elephant so covered with rich hangings and
embellished with scintillating gems that scarce more than
the beast's eyes and feet were visible.

Menelek was a rather gross-looking man, well past middle
age, but he carried himself with an air of dignity befitting
one descended in unbroken line from the Prophet--as was his
claim.

His eyes were bright but crafty, and his features denoted
both sensuality and cruelness.  In his youth he may have
been a rather fine looking black, but when I saw him his
appearance was revolting--to me, at least.

Following the emperor came regiment after regiment from the
various branches of the service, among them batteries of
field guns mounted on elephants.

In the center of the troops following the imperial elephant
marched a great caravan of slaves.  The old street sweeper
at my elbow told me that these were the gifts brought in
from the far outlying districts by the commanding officers
of the frontier posts.  The majority of them were women,
destined, I was told, for the harems of the emperor and his
favorites.  It made my old companion clench his fists to see
those poor white women marching past to their horrid fates,
and, though I shared his sentiments, I was as powerless to
alter their destinies as he.

For a week the troops kept pouring in and out of New Gondar--
in, always, from the south and west, but always toward the
east.  Each new contingent brought its gifts to the emperor.
From the south they brought rugs and ornaments and jewels;
from the west, slaves; for the commanding officers of the
western frontier posts had naught else to bring.

From the number of women they brought, I judged that they
knew the weakness of their imperial master.

And then soldiers commenced coming in from the east, but not
with the gay assurance of those who came from the south and
west--no, these others came in covered wagons, blood-soaked
and suffering.  They came at first in little parties of
eight or ten, and then they came in fifties, in hundreds,
and one day a thousand maimed and dying men were carted into
New Gondar.

It was then that Menelek XIV became uneasy.  For fifty years
his armies had conquered wherever they had marched.  At
first he had led them in person, lately his presence within
a hundred miles of the battle line had been sufficient for
large engagements--for minor ones only the knowledge that
they were fighting for the glory of their sovereign was
necessary to win victories.

One morning, New Gondar was awakened by the booming of
cannon.  It was the first intimation that the townspeople
had received that the enemy was forcing the imperial troops
back upon the city.  Dust covered couriers galloped in from
the front.  Fresh troops hastened from the city, and about
noon Menelek rode out surrounded by his staff.

For three days thereafter we could hear the cannonading and
the spitting of the small arms, for the battle line was
scarce two leagues from New Gondar.  The city was filled
with wounded.  Just outside, soldiers were engaged in
throwing up earthworks.  It was evident to the least
enlightened that Menelek expected further reverses.

And then the imperial troops fell back upon these new
defenses, or, rather, they were forced back by the enemy.
Shells commenced to fall within the city.  Menelek returned
and took up his headquarters in the stone building that was
called the palace.  That night came a lull in the
hostilities--a truce had been arranged.

Colonel Belik summoned me about seven o'clock to dress him
for a function at the palace.  In the midst of death and
defeat the emperor was about to give a great banquet to his
officers.  I was to accompany my master and wait upon him--
I, Jefferson Turck, lieutenant in the Pan-American navy!

In the privacy of the colonel's quarters I had become
accustomed to my menial duties, lightened as they were by
the natural kindliness of my master, but the thought of
appearing in public as a common slave revolted every fine
instinct within me.  Yet there was nothing for it but to
obey.

I cannot, even now, bring myself to a narration of the
humiliation which I experienced that night as I stood behind
my black master in silent servility, now pouring his wine,
now cutting up his meats for him, now fanning him with a
large, plumed fan of feathers.

As fond as I had grown of him, I could have thrust a knife
into him, so keenly did I feel the affront that had been put
upon me.  But at last the long banquet was concluded.  The
tables were removed.  The emperor ascended a dais at one end
of the room and seated himself upon a throne, and the
entertainment commenced.  It was only what ancient history
might have led me to expect--musicians, dancing girls,
jugglers, and the like.

Near midnight, the master of ceremonies announced that the
slave women who had been presented to the emperor since his
arrival in New Gondar would be exhibited, that the royal
host would select such as he wished, after which he would
present the balance of them to his guests.  Ah, what royal
generosity!

A small door at one side of the room opened, and the poor
creatures filed in and were ranged in a long line before the
throne.  Their backs were toward me.  I saw only an
occasional profile as now and then a bolder spirit among
them turned to survey the apartment and the gorgeous
assemblage of officers in their brilliant dress uniforms.
They were profiles of young girls, and pretty, but horror
was indelibly stamped upon them all.  I shuddered as I
contemplated their sad fate, and turned my eyes away.

I heard the master of ceremonies command them to prostrate
themselves before the emperor, and the sounds as they went
upon their knees before him, touching their foreheads to the
floor.  Then came the official's voice again, in sharp and
peremptory command.

"Down, slave!" he cried.  "Make obeisance to your
sovereign!"

I looked up, attracted by the tone of the man's voice, to
see a single, straight, slim figure standing erect in the
center of the line of prostrate girls, her arms folded
across her breast and little chin in the air.  Her back was
toward me--I could not see her face, though I should like to
see the countenance of this savage young lioness, standing
there defiant among that herd of terrified sheep.

"Down!  Down!" shouted the master of ceremonies, taking a
step toward her and half drawing his sword.

My blood boiled.  To stand there, inactive, while a negro
struck down that brave girl of my own race!  Instinctively I
took a forward step to place myself in the man's path.  But
at the same instant Menelek raised his hand in a gesture
that halted the officer.  The emperor seemed interested, but
in no way angered at the girl's attitude.

"Let us inquire," he said in a smooth, pleasant voice, "why
this young woman refuses to do homage to her sovereign," and
he put the question himself directly to her.

She answered him in Abyssinian, but brokenly and with an
accent that betrayed how recently she had acquired her
slight knowledge of the tongue.

"I go on my knees to no one," she said.  "I have no
sovereign.  I myself am sovereign in my own country."

Menelek, at her words, leaned back in his throne and laughed
uproariously.  Following his example, which seemed always
the correct procedure, the assembled guests vied with one
another in an effort to laugh more noisily than the emperor.

The girl but tilted her chin a bit higher in the air--even
her back proclaimed her utter contempt for her captors.
Finally Menelek restored quiet by the simple expedient of a
frown, whereupon each loyal guest exchanged his mirthful
mien for an emulative scowl.

"And who," asked Menelek, "are you, and by what name is your
country called?"

"I am Victory, Queen of Grabritin," replied the girl so
quickly and so unexpectedly that I gasped in astonishment.



9


Victory!  She was here, a slave to these black conquerors.
Once more I started toward her, but better judgment held me
back--I could do nothing to help her other than by stealth.
Could I even accomplish aught by this means?  I did not
know.  It seemed beyond the pale of possibility, and yet I
should try.

"And you will not bend the knee to me?" continued Menelek,
after she had spoken.  Victory shook her head in a most
decided negation.

"You shall be my first choice, then," said the emperor.  "I
like your spirit, for the breaking of it will add to my
pleasure in you, and never fear but that it shall be broken--
this very night.  Take her to my apartments," and he
motioned to an officer at his side

I was surprised to see Victory follow the man off in
apparent quiet submission.  I tried to follow, that I might
be near her against some opportunity to speak with her or
assist in her escape.  But, after I had followed them from
the throne room, through several other apartments, and down
a long corridor, I found my further progress barred by a
soldier who stood guard before a doorway through which the
officer conducted Victory.

Almost immediately the officer reappeared and started back
in the direction of the throne room.  I had been hiding in a
doorway after the guard had turned me back, having taken
refuge there while his back was turned, and, as the officer
approached me, I withdrew into the room beyond, which was in
darkness.  There I remained for a long time, watching the
sentry before the door of the room in which Victory was a
prisoner, and awaiting some favorable circumstance which
would give me entry to her.

I have not attempted to fully describe my sensations at the
moment I recognized Victory, because, I can assure you, they
were entirely indescribable.  I should never have imagined
that the sight of any human being could affect me as had
this unexpected discovery of Victory in the same room in
which I was, while I had thought of her for weeks either as
dead, or at best hundreds of miles to the west, and as
irretrievably lost to me as though she were, in truth, dead.

I was filled with a strange, mad impulse to be near her.  It
was not enough merely to assist her, or protect her--I
desired to touch her--to take her in my arms.  I was
astounded at myself.  Another thing puzzled me--it was my
incomprehensible feeling of elation since I had again seen
her.  With a fate worse than death staring her in the face,
and with the knowledge that I should probably die defending
her within the hour, I was still happier than I had been for
weeks--and all because I had seen again for a few brief
minutes the figure of a little heathen maiden.  I couldn't
account for it, and it angered me; I had never before felt
any such sensations in the presence of a woman, and I had
made love to some very beautiful ones in my time.

It seemed ages that I stood in the shadow of that doorway,
in the ill-lit corridor of the palace of Menelek XIV.  A
sickly gas jet cast a sad pallor upon the black face of the
sentry.  The fellow seemed rooted to the spot.  Evidently he
would never leave, or turn his back again.

I had been in hiding but a short time when I heard the sound
of distant cannon.  The truce had ended, and the battle had
been resumed.  Very shortly thereafter the earth shook to
the explosion of a shell within the city, and from time to
time thereafter other shells burst at no great distance from
the palace.  The yellow men were bombarding New Gondar
again.

Presently officers and slaves commenced to traverse the
corridor on matters pertaining to their duties, and then
came the emperor, scowling and wrathful.  He was followed by
a few personal attendants, whom he dismissed at the doorway
to his apartments--the same doorway through which Victory
had been taken.  I chafed to follow him, but the corridor
was filled with people.  At last they betook themselves to
their own apartments, which lay upon either side of the
corridor.

An officer and a slave entered the very room in which I hid,
forcing me to flatten myself to one side in the darkness
until they had passed.  Then the slave made a light, and I
knew that I must find another hiding place.

Stepping boldly into the corridor, I saw that it was now
empty save for the single sentry before the emperor's door.
He glanced up as I emerged from the room, the occupants of
which had not seen me.  I walked straight toward the
soldier, my mind made up in an instant.  I tried to simulate
an expression of cringing servility, and I must have
succeeded, for I entirely threw the man off his guard, so
that he permitted me to approach within reach of his rifle
before stopping me.  Then it was too late--for him.

Without a word or a warning, I snatched the piece from his
grasp, and, at the same time struck him a terrific blow
between the eyes with my clenched fist.  He staggered back
in surprise, too dumbfounded even to cry out, and then I
clubbed his rifle and felled him with a single mighty blow.

A moment later, I had burst into the room beyond.  It was
empty!

I gazed about, mad with disappointment.  Two doors opened
from this to other rooms.  I ran to the nearer and listened.
Yes, voices were coming from beyond and one was a woman's,
level and cold and filled with scorn.  There was no terror
in it.  It was Victory's.

I turned the knob and pushed the door inward just in time to
see Menelek seize the girl and drag her toward the far end
of the apartment.  At the same instant there was a deafening
roar just outside the palace--a shell had struck much nearer
than any of its predecessors.  The noise of it drowned my
rapid rush across the room.

But in her struggles, Victory turned Menelek about so that
he saw me.  She was striking him in the face with her
clenched fist, and now he was choking her.

At sight of me, he gave voice to a roar of anger.

"What means this, slave?" he cried.  "Out of here! Out of
here!  Quick, before I kill you!"

But for answer I rushed upon him, striking him with the butt
of the rifle.  He staggered back, dropping Victory to the
floor, and then he cried aloud for the guard, and came at
me.  Again and again I struck him; but his thick skull might
have been armor plate, for all the damage I did it.

He tried to close with me, seizing the rifle, but I was
stronger than he, and, wrenching the weapon from his grasp,
tossed it aside and made for his throat with my bare hands.
I had not dared fire the weapon for fear that its report
would bring the larger guard stationed at the farther end of
the corridor.

We struggled about the room, striking one another, knocking
over furniture, and rolling upon the floor.  Menelek was a
powerful man, and he was fighting for his life.  Continually
he kept calling for the guard, until I succeeded in getting
a grip upon his throat; but it was too late.  His cries had
been heard, and suddenly the door burst open, and a score of
armed guardsmen rushed into the apartment.

Victory seized the rifle from the floor and leaped between
me and them.  I had the black emperor upon his back, and
both my hands were at his throat, choking the life from him.

The rest happened in the fraction of a second.  There was a
rending crash above us, then a deafening explosion within
the chamber.  Smoke and powder fumes filled the room.  Half
stunned, I rose from the lifeless body of my antagonist just
in time to see Victory stagger to her feet and turn toward
me.  Slowly the smoke cleared to reveal the shattered
remnants of the guard.  A shell had fallen through the
palace roof and exploded just in the rear of the detachment
of guardsmen who were coming to the rescue of their emperor.
Why neither Victory nor I were struck is a miracle.  The
room was a wreck.  A great, jagged hole was torn in the
ceiling, and the wall toward the corridor had been blown
entirely out.

As I rose, Victory had risen, too, and started toward me.
But when she saw that I was uninjured she stopped, and stood
there in the center of the demolished apartment looking at
me.  Her expression was inscrutable--I could not guess
whether she was glad to see me, or not.

"Victory!" I cried.  "Thank God that you are safe!" And I
approached her, a greater gladness in my heart than I had
felt since the moment that I knew the Coldwater must be
swept beyond thirty.

There was no answering gladness in her eyes.  Instead, she
stamped her little foot in anger.

"Why did it have to be you who saved me!" she exclaimed.  "I
hate you!"

"Hate me?" I asked.  "Why should you hate me, Victory?  I do
not hate you.  I--I--"  What was I about to say?  I was very
close to her as a great light broke over me.  Why had I
never realized it before?  The truth accounted for a great
many hitherto inexplicable moods that had claimed me from
time to time since first I had seen Victory.

"Why should I hate you?" she repeated.  "Because Snider told
me--he told me that you had promised me to him, but he did
not get me.  I killed him, as I should like to kill you!"

"Snider lied!" I cried.  And then I seized her and held her
in my arms, and made her listen to me, though she struggled
and fought like a young lioness.  "I love you, Victory.  You
must know that I love you--that I have always loved you, and
that I never could have made so base a promise."

She ceased her struggles, just a trifle, but still tried to
push me from her.  "You called me a barbarian!" she said.

Ah, so that was it!  That still rankled.  I crushed her to
me.

"You could not love a barbarian," she went on, but she had
ceased to struggle.

"But I do love a barbarian, Victory!" I cried, "the dearest
barbarian in the world."

She raised her eyes to mine, and then her smooth, brown arms
encircled my neck and drew my lips down to hers.

"I love you--I have loved you always!" she said, and then
she buried her face upon my shoulder and sobbed.  "I have
been so unhappy," she said, "but I could not die while I
thought that you might live."

As we stood there, momentarily forgetful of all else than
our new found happiness, the ferocity of the bombardment
increased until scarce thirty seconds elapsed between the
shells that rained about the palace.

To remain long would be to invite certain death.  We could
not escape the way that we had entered the apartment, for
not only was the corridor now choked with debris, but beyond
the corridor there were doubtless many members of the
emperor's household who would stop us.

Upon the opposite side of the room was another door, and
toward this I led the way.  It opened into a third apartment
with windows overlooking an inner court.  From one of these
windows I surveyed the courtyard.  Apparently it was empty,
and the rooms upon the opposite side were unlighted.

Assisting Victory to the open, I followed, and together we
crossed the court, discovering upon the opposite side a
number of wide, wooden doors set in the wall of the palace,
with small windows between.  As we stood close behind one of
the doors, listening, a horse within neighed.

"The stables!" I whispered, and, a moment later, had pushed
back a door and entered.  From the city about us we could
hear the din of great commotion, and quite close the sounds
of battle--the crack of thousands of rifles, the yells of
the soldiers, the hoarse commands of officers, and the blare
of bugles.

The bombardment had ceased as suddenly as it had commenced.
I judged that the enemy was storming the city, for the
sounds we heard were the sounds of hand-to-hand combat.

Within the stables I groped about until I had found saddles
and bridles for two horses.  But afterward, in the darkness,
I could find but a single mount.  The doors of the opposite
side, leading to the street, were open, and we could see
great multitudes of men, women, and children fleeing toward
the west.  Soldiers, afoot and mounted, were joining the mad
exodus.  Now and then a camel or an elephant would pass
bearing some officer or dignitary to safety.  It was evident
that the city would fall at any moment--a fact which was
amply proclaimed by the terror-stricken haste of the fear-
mad mob.

Horse, camel, and elephant trod helpless women and children
beneath their feet.  A common soldier dragged a general from
his mount, and, leaping to the animal's back, fled down the
packed street toward the west.  A woman seized a gun and
brained a court dignitary, whose horse had trampled her
child to death.  Shrieks, curses, commands, supplications
filled the air.  It was a frightful scene--one that will be
burned upon my memory forever.

I had saddled and bridled the single horse which had
evidently been overlooked by the royal household in its
flight, and, standing a little back in the shadow of the
stable's interior, Victory and I watched the surging throng
without.

To have entered it would have been to have courted greater
danger than we were already in.  We decided to wait until
the stress of blacks thinned, and for more than an hour we
stood there while the sounds of battle raged upon the
eastern side of the city and the population flew toward the
west.  More and more numerous became the uniformed soldiers
among the fleeing throng, until, toward the last, the street
was packed with them.  It was no orderly retreat, but a
rout, complete and terrible.

The fighting was steadily approaching us now, until the
crack of rifles sounded in the very street upon which we
were looking.  And then came a handful of brave men--a
little rear guard backing slowly toward the west, working
their smoking rifles in feverish haste as they fired volley
after volley at the foe we could not see.

But these were pressed back and back until the first line of
the enemy came opposite our shelter.  They were men of
medium height, with olive complexions and almond eyes.  In
them I recognized the descendants of the ancient Chinese
race.

They were well uniformed and superbly armed, and they fought
bravely and under perfect discipline.  So rapt was I in the
exciting events transpiring in the street that I did not
hear the approach of a body of men from behind.  It was a
party of the conquerors who had entered the palace and were
searching it.

They came upon us so unexpectedly that we were prisoners
before we realized what had happened.  That night we were
held under a strong guard just outside the eastern wall of
the city, and the next morning were started upon a long
march toward the east.

Our captors were not unkind to us, and treated the women
prisoners with respect.  We marched for many days--so many
that I lost count of them--and at last we came to another
city--a Chinese city this time--which stands upon the site
of ancient Moscow.

It is only a small frontier city, but it is well built and
well kept.  Here a large military force is maintained, and
here also, is a terminus of the railroad that crosses modern
China to the Pacific.

There was every evidence of a high civilization in all that
we saw within the city, which, in connection with the humane
treatment that had been accorded all prisoners upon the long
and tiresome march, encouraged me to hope that I might
appeal to some high officer here for the treatment which my
rank and birth merited.

We could converse with our captors only through the medium
of interpreters who spoke both Chinese and Abyssinian.  But
there were many of these, and shortly after we reached the
city I persuaded one of them to carry a verbal message to
the officer who had commanded the troops during the return
from New Gondar, asking that I might be given a hearing by
some high official.

The reply to my request was a summons to appear before the
officer to whom I had addressed my appeal.  A sergeant came
for me along with the interpreter, and I managed to obtain
his permission to let Victory accompany me--I had never left
her alone with the prisoners since we had been captured.

To my delight I found that the officer into whose presence
we were conducted spoke Abyssinian fluently.  He was
astounded when I told him that I was a Pan-American.  Unlike
all others whom I had spoken with since my arrival in
Europe, he was well acquainted with ancient history--was
familiar with twentieth century conditions in Pan-America,
and after putting a half dozen questions to me was satisfied
that I spoke the truth.

When I told him that Victory was Queen of England he showed
little surprise, telling me that in their recent
explorations in ancient Russia they had found many
descendants of the old nobility and royalty.

He immediately set aside a comfortable house for us,
furnished us with servants and with money, and in other ways
showed us every attention and kindness.

He told me that he would telegraph his emperor at once, and
the result was that we were presently commanded to repair to
Peking and present ourselves before the ruler.

We made the journey in a comfortable railway carriage,
through a country which, as we traveled farther toward the
east, showed increasing evidence of prosperity and wealth.

At the imperial court we were received with great kindness,
the emperor being most inquisitive about the state of modern
Pan-America.  He told me that while he personally deplored
the existence of the strict regulations which had raised a
barrier between the east and the west, he had felt, as had
his predecessors, that recognition of the wishes of the
great Pan-American federation would be most conducive to the
continued peace of the world.

His empire includes all of Asia, and the islands of the
Pacific as far east as 175dW.  The empire of Japan no longer
exists, having been conquered and absorbed by China over a
hundred years ago.  The Philippines are well administered,
and constitute one of the most progressive colonies of the
Chinese empire.

The emperor told me that the building of this great empire
and the spreading of enlightenment among its diversified and
savage peoples had required all the best efforts of nearly
two hundred years.  Upon his accession to the throne he had
found the labor well nigh perfected and had turned his
attention to the reclamation of Europe.

His ambition is to wrest it from the hands of the blacks,
and then to attempt the work of elevating its fallen peoples
to the high estate from which the Great War precipitated
them.

I asked him who was victorious in that war, and he shook his
head sadly as he replied:

"Pan-America, perhaps, and China, with the blacks of
Abyssinia," he said.  "Those who did not fight were the only
ones to reap any of the rewards that are supposed to belong
to victory.  The combatants reaped naught but annihilation.
You have seen--better than any man you must realize that
there was no victory for any nation embroiled in that
frightful war."

"When did it end?" I asked him.

Again he shook his head.  "It has not ended yet.  There has
never been a formal peace declared in Europe.  After a while
there were none left to make peace, and the rude tribes
which sprang from the survivors continued to fight among
themselves because they knew no better condition of society.
War razed the works of man--war and pestilence razed man.
God give that there shall never be such another war!"

You all know how Porfirio Johnson returned to Pan-America
with John Alvarez in chains; how Alvarez's trial raised a
popular demonstration that the government could not ignore.
His eloquent appeal--not for himself, but for me--is
historic, as are its results.  You know how a fleet was sent
across the Atlantic to search for me, how the restrictions
against crossing thirty to one hundred seventy-five were
removed forever, and how the officers were brought to
Peking, arriving upon the very day that Victory and I were
married at the imperial court.

My return to Pan-America was very different from anything I
could possibly have imagined a year before.  Instead of
being received as a traitor to my country, I was acclaimed a
hero.  It was good to get back again, good to witness the
kindly treatment that was accorded my dear Victory, and when
I learned that Delcarte and Taylor had been found at the
mouth of the Rhine and were already back in Pan-America my
joy was unalloyed.

And now we are going back, Victory and I, with the men and
the munitions and power to reclaim England for her queen.
Again I shall cross thirty, but under what altered
conditions!

A new epoch for Europe is inaugurated, with enlightened
China on the east and enlightened Pan-America on the west--
the two great peace powers whom God has preserved to
regenerate chastened and forgiven Europe.  I have been
through much--I have suffered much, but I have won two great
laurel wreaths beyond thirty.  One is the opportunity to
rescue Europe from barbarism, the other is a little
barbarian, and the greater of these is--Victory.
