“I watched when the World Trade Center came tumbling down,” he told a crowd in Birmingham, Ala., on Saturday. “And I watched in Jersey City, New Jersey, where thousands and thousands of people were cheering as that building was coming down.”

No news reports exist of people cheering in the streets, and both police officials and the mayor of Jersey City have said that it did not happen. An Internet rumor about people cheering in the streets, which said it was in Paterson, not Jersey City, has been denied numerous times by city and police officials.

But when pressed on Sunday by George Stephanopoulos in an interview, Mr. Trump emphatically stuck to his story.

“It did happen, I saw it,” Mr. Trump said. “It was on television. I saw it.”

When reminded that police said it didn’t happen, Mr. Trump again insisted that he saw it.

“I know it might be not politically correct for you to talk about it, but there were people cheering as that building came down — as those buildings came down. And that tells you something,” he said. “It was well covered at the time, George.”

In New Hampshire on Sunday, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey said he had no recollection of state residents celebrating the terror attacks in 2001.

“I think if it had happened, I would remember it,” Mr. Christie said.

Also on Sunday, Mr. Trump reiterated many of his emphatic, if controversial, positions in the wake of the terrorist attacks in Paris. He said he would not unequivocally rule out a database on all Muslims and that he wants a database of refugees and surveillance of certain mosques.

He also said that he would bring back interrogation techniques like waterboarding.

“We have to be strong,” he said in response to Mr. Stephanopoulos’s question. “You know, they don’t use waterboarding over there; they use chopping off people’s heads. They use drowning people.”

When asked if that meant he would bring back waterboarding, Mr. Trump said, “We have to — I would bring it back, yes. I would bring it back. I think waterboarding is peanuts compared to what they’d do to us.”

The terrorist attacks in Paris dominated the Sunday news shows, as every presidential candidate’s interviews focused nearly exclusively on the attacks. And each candidate tried to point to his record as evidence of why he is best positioned to defeat the Islamic State.

Mr. Christie reiterated, as he often has on the campaign trail, that he is the only candidate “who has actually done this before,” pointing to his tenure as United States attorney for New Jersey, when he “brought two of the most major terrorism cases this country has brought in the aftermath of September 11.”

Mr. Christie called for rebuilding the intelligence programs, in particular the National Security Agency’s metadata collection program, during his interview on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, whose appearance on “Fox News Sunday” was timed with the release of his first television ad, which also focused on the Paris attacks, laid out a detailed plan on how to combat the Islamic State in Syria, including by expanding air strikes and providing arms, training and American troops to help arm “Arab Sunnis” to combat terrorists in Syria.

“There will have to be American operators embedded alongside them,” he said. “Special operators are combat troops. This is not a return to Iraq. We’re not talking about 100,000 people or 50,000 armed soldiers.”

Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon, also called for increased intelligence gathering, and pointed to his record as a surgeon to show his readiness in the face of emergencies.

“I would be willing to say that I probably have more 2 a.m.-in-the-morning experience than everybody else running combined, making life and death decisions,” Mr. Carson said in an appearance on “This Week” on ABC.

The focus on the Paris attacks dominated the interviews despite a series of new polls released early Sunday morning, all with Mr. Trump holding a commanding lead in both nationwide and state-specific polling.

But his strong standing among Republicans was not enough for Mr. Trump to again reverse his position on a possible independent run.
“I will see what happens,” he said in response to a question about a potential independent run. “I have to be treated fairly.”

Marco Rubio’s campaign is hitting the airwaves, releasing its first television ad on Sunday.

Mr. Rubio’s first ad focuses exclusively on the Paris attacks and the issue of national security. It will run nationwide on cable networks; the Rubio campaign did not say how much it was spending to air the ad.

The ad is simple: Mr. Rubio appears before a black background and speaks directly to the camera, with a slim black shadow creeping into his visage from the side of the camera.

“What happened in Paris could happen here,” Mr. Rubio says in the ad. “There is no middle ground.”

The context of the ad is a binary choice of “us or them.” Mr. Rubio has tried to portray himself in this election contest as the strongest choice to combat terrorism around the world.

The ad closes with a slightly longer riff than the usually rushed approval: “I’m Marco Rubio. I approve this message because there can be no arrangement or negotiation. Either they win or we do.”

Drones are expected to be hot sellers this holiday season. Now it looks as if owners of nearly all those machines will have to register with the federal government and have the information placed in a national database, as officials look to address concerns over safety and the mischief caused by unmanned aircraft.

The proposed regulations were outlined in a report released on Monday by the Federal Aviation Administration. The recommendations came from a task force created by the agency and are widely expected to be approved in a few weeks, ahead of what is expected to be a big increase of drone owners after Christmas.

The Consumer Technology Association, a trade group, has estimated that 400,000 drones will be sold this holiday season.

The task force said that in addition to being entered in a federal database, drone owners should display a government-issued registration number on the machines. It recommended that owners submit their names and addresses, but said email addresses and phone numbers should be optional. The rules would apply to drones weighing half a pound to 55 pounds.

The task force did not go as far with its recommendations as some advocates of stricter regulations had hoped. It said owners of aircraft should not have to submit any information about their aircraft, for example. It also said there should not be a requirement for drone users to be citizens or permanent residents.

The task force wrote that the goal of the registration process was to “ensure accountability by creating a traceable link between aircraft and owner, and to encourage the maximum levels of regulatory compliance by making the registration process as simple as possible.”

Task force members included representatives of drone makers, technology companies, an airline pilots association and government officials. They stressed that many compromises were made.

“We tried to write it in as generic a flavor as possible,” Dave Vos, a member of the task force and the head of a drone project at Google X, a business that works on future technologies, said in a conference call.

With the “consensus we reached, everyone is quite happy here,” he said.

The recommendations will be considered as part of official rules for drones being developed by the F.A.A. But the agency pushed for the task force to complete its report before the holiday season.

The F.A.A. will receive comments on the report before considering the recommendations for final rules.

A giant cardboard picture, tattered by time, rests against a wall in Joshua Adams’s home. It shows a radiant young woman with an Auburn University corsage hugging the university’s mascot, a tiger. She is Auburn’s homecoming queen — and Mr. Adams’s mother.

The university dominates this city of 60,000, with football its spiritual center. And as Mr. Adams will attest, sports competition extends beyond the field. “Betting for me started when I was 13 years old,” he said, adding that bookies were never hard to find.

Years later, Mr. Adams relished joining his college pals in Atlanta, where they would throw a modest sum of money into a pot and select their fantasy football teams for a season-long competition. “It was one of the most fun days of the year,” he said. “People were getting married and having kids, and this was the one time we would all come together.”


By then, Mr. Adams knew he had a gambling problem, but games with a single payout after the season did not seem to him like gambling. It was very different, though, when the action became daily, offering quick payouts, hundreds of bets each day and six-figure cash prizes. Mr. Adams called it “a game changer” — and counselors say they are seeing people like Mr. Adams and are expecting many more.

“It would be akin to an alcoholic finding out about a whole new street of bars that he never knew about — exciting, great bars,” he said. “For an addict, it wasn’t what I needed.” Mr. Adams said he had lost $20,000 in daily fantasy games and tens of thousands more in illegal sports bets. His life, consumed by gambling, disintegrated to where he considered suicide.

Mr. Adams’s story, and others like it, have been largely absent from the cacophony of voices debating whether fantasy sports — an unregulated multibillion-dollar industry financed by media companies, hedge funds and professional sports organizations — constitutes gambling.

The fantasy companies say their daily games are not gambling, contending that the games involve more skill than luck. “Our product is all about entertainment value,” said Matt King, chief financial officer of FanDuel, one of the largest daily fantasy sports providers.

In 2006, Congress tried to crack down on illegal online sports betting. Today, Internet wagering is thriving, and a new business that resembles gambling, fantasy sports, is winning millions of players and stoking controversy. The Times, with the PBS series “Frontline,” investigated illegal gambling in the Internet age.

Have a question or anonymous tip?
Increasingly, that view is coming under attack, notably by New York’s attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman. Two weeks ago, Mr. Schneiderman ordered FanDuel and its major competitor, DraftKings, to stop accepting bets from New Yorkers because their games constituted illegal gambling under state law. Both companies are contesting that order in court.

For people like Mr. Adams, now in his mid-30s, this battle is about more than just the letter of the law. In the unregulated world of fantasy sports, it is also about the absence of safeguards to protect problem gamblers and younger adults.

“Absolutely it is gambling,” said Mr. Adams, who holds a master’s degree in rural sociology and considers himself a child of privilege. “I wish I never would have gotten back into playing fantasy sports, because for me, and I think for compulsive gamblers, it leads us right back into a destructive state.”

Fantasy games appeal to the demographic most likely to develop gambling problems — young men, who researchers say are more prone to taking risks. FanDuel readily admits that it targets millennials.

Fantasy contests have become so popular, and their advertisements so ubiquitous, that gambling counselors say young children are now playing with their fathers or, in some cases, by themselves. Neva Pryor, who counsels gamblers in New Jersey, said that at a recent conference, teachers were saying that on Monday mornings, “all the students talk about is fantasy sports.”

Most people can play daily fantasy or casino games without a problem. “I know there are people that can do it normally,” Mr. Adams said, but he is not one of them. He also acknowledges that he ultimately bears responsibility for his addiction.

Yet gambling counselors say they could more easily help people like Mr. Adams if fantasy companies did not portray their games as involving mostly skill. That alone is a risk for addiction, said Keith Whyte, executive director of the National Council on Problem Gambling.

“The perception of skill has led many, many people down a very dark path,” he said.

Seeking Help

The difference between regulated and unregulated betting is evident in the websites of casinos and fantasy companies.

Because online betting is legal in New Jersey, the Borgata casino can offer Pick the Pros, where players must select winning football teams for a shot at $200,000. Borgata’s home page includes the note, “Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER.” That number connects to a help hotline.

With problem gamblers, the Borgata said, “We believe it is our responsibility to offer information and assistance.”

In contrast, fantasy players may bet thousands of dollars a day, yet neither FanDuel nor DraftKings mentions 1-800-GAMBLER on its website. “We have consistently urged them to list our help line and website,” Mr. Whyte said. Mr. Adams said his first step toward breaking his addiction had occurred when he saw the 1-800 number — but it was not on a fantasy sports site.

In the wake of the New York attorney general’s legal challenge, DraftKings changed its website a week ago to warn that playing fantasy sports could be a “stress-inducer.” But the word “gambling” does not appear, nor does the help line. Instead, the company refers players to the National Center for Responsible Gaming, a research group funded in part by the casino industry.

That group “is not a consumer protection advocate,” Mr. Whyte said. “They do good research and are a fine group, but they don’t provide direct services to problem gamblers like we do.”

FanDuel said in a statement: “In any nascent, disruptive industry, important questions are often raised about how the industry should operate. Fantasy sports is no different, and we are reviewing our policies and practices to ensure consumers have a positive experience on our site.” The company said it already had a process by which players could opt out of games.

DraftKings issued a statement saying “we are continuously optimizing our site to ensure our product is best in class and this includes consumer protections.”

Players who bet excessively are usually the last to recognize it, underscoring the need, counselors say, for fantasy sites to list warning signs, such as lying about time or money lost to betting.

Mr. Adams said he routinely lied to get money — for example, telling his parents he needed a new roof. “I don’t know how many roofs I’ve put on my house,” he said.

Problem gamblers also deceive themselves, believing their luck will turn.

“What’s interesting about daily fantasy, the way the marketing works, is that you have new winners every day or every weekend,” said Daniel Trolaro, who educates people on compulsive gambling. “So for the problem gambler who thinks that he or she is simply one bet away from winning back and solving their problems, they have ample opportunity on a daily basis to do that.”

Even gamblers who have decided to stop playing fantasy sports have trouble breaking away.

Jennifer Alfert, a certified gambling counselor in Boca Raton, Fla., said a client who had quit gambling confided that, in September, DraftKings had offered to let him play for free if he signed up a friend — which he did, and he won $35.

“Rather than wait for a relapse,” Ms. Alfert said, “I opted to intervene.” So in October, she said, she asked her client, whom she identified only by his first name, Matt, to ask DraftKings to block his access.

“I no longer wish to be able to bet,” Matt told the company in an email. “Additionally I would like the balance of my winnings in the form of a check to a cause to help gamblers.”

Instead of acting promptly upon his request, DraftKings emailed him promotional materials that included statements like: “You Scored Big! Your invite is inside: Claim your FREE Entry” and “We’ve selected you for this! Your shot at winning $100K tonight.”

Matt has yet to receive his money, Ms. Alfert said.

Different Approaches

On Thursday, Massachusetts joined Nevada and New York in seeking to corral fantasy betting. But while Nevada and New York have banned daily fantasy games, Massachusetts opted to regulate it by proposing safeguards.

The attorney general, Maura Healey, said in a statement that the regulations were intended to protect minors and to ensure fair competition and truthful advertising.

Massachusetts will no longer allow anyone under age 21 to play daily fantasy sports. Operators say they accept only players who are 18 or older, but players as young as 14 are playing daily fantasy, according to the Council on Compulsive Gambling of New Jersey. The Times interviewed a player who began betting at 15.

The council’s director, Neva Pryor, said fantasy sites should require players to prove their age with a driver’s license. “There’s no age control, really,” Ms. Pryor said. “You can simply open an account in your name, check a box, and put in whatever age you want to put in.” Parents have opened accounts for children.

Massachusetts also wants to limit how daily fantasy companies entice college students. DraftKings offers a fantasy college basketball competition and a chance to win a share of $1 million as the “Fantasy College Football World Champion.”

Under the state’s proposal, operators could no longer offer contests involving colleges.

Daily fantasy companies have until Jan. 22 to comment on the proposal. Both DraftKings and FanDuel have said they prefer Ms. Healey’s approach to Mr. Schneiderman’s.

FanDuel said Massachusetts’s approach “makes a tremendous amount of sense.” DraftKings offered a more tempered response. “While we do have some concerns with the draft regulations, we intend to work closely with the Attorney General’s office to ensure we are operating in the best interest of our customers,” the company said.

A Gambler’s Way Back

One day last week, Mr. Adams rolled up his sleeve to show a tattoo of a bar code and a date in May 2014. He wanted a reminder of the day he began to reclaim his life — his last bet.


It was on a tennis match, not that he knew much about tennis, nor about Japanese basketball. He bet on that, too. The bar code is a reminder of how much money he has lost.

Breaking his addiction required 25 days in a rehabilitation center and continuing meetings at Gamblers Anonymous. The final step of recovery is to help other gamblers, and that is why he is telling his story, of the people he hurt, of the lost days he can never recover.

“In Gamblers Anonymous, we talk about prison, insanity or death,” he said. “The three aren’t mutually exclusive. I think I was definitely on my way to all three of those places.”

The posters, put up by a year-old student group called the Black Justice League, featured some of Wilson’s more offensive quotes, including his comment to an African-American leader that “segregation is not humiliating, but a benefit, and ought to be so regarded by you,” and led to a remarkable two days at this genteel campus last week.

After a walkout by about 200 students, and the presentation by the Black Justice League of a list of demands, about 15 students occupied the office of the president, Christopher L. Eisgruber, overnight on Wednesday. On Thursday, Mr. Eisgruber agreed to begin discussions on campus and with trustees about the demands.

At the top of the group’s list was a demand that the university “publicly acknowledge the racist legacy of Woodrow Wilson” and take steps to rename the public policy school and residential college.

While naming decisions are up to the university’s board of trustees (which includes Mr. Eisgruber), Mr. Eisgruber promised to push for removing a large mural of Wilson from the residential college’s dining room and to direct the trustees to survey “the campus community’s opinion” on the Wilson School name and then vote on it.

The protesters also called for mandatory courses on “the history of marginalized peoples,” for “cultural competency training” for the staff and the faculty and for the creation of dedicated housing and meeting space for those interested in black culture.

But as Princeton takes its turn in the national roll call of college campuses where long-festering issues of race have burst into the open, spurred by events in places like Ferguson, Mo., and Charleston, S.C., it is not surprising that the conversation would pivot around Wilson, an alumnus.

“In some ways, that’s the role that symbols play in American politics and culture,” Mr. Eisgruber said in a phone interview on Sunday before sending an email addressing the issue to the university community. “People become very invested in symbols. And one of the benefits of having a genuine public discussion, informed by scholarly opinion, about some of these questions is that it can help educate people about problems that go beyond the symbol in our society.”


In the wake of the sit-in, students were divided on the renaming; even many sympathetic to the Black Justice League’s other demands said that expunging Wilson’s name went too far, or was unlikely to serve a constructive purpose, or both.

A counterpetition circulating on Change.org called the proposal a “dangerous precedent” for future students who “seek to purge the past of those who fail to live up to modern standards of morality,” as well as a bid to erase Wilson’s positive contributions.

But one Black Justice League member, Wilglory Tanjong, rejected that argument.


Raised in the South, he wrote of “a great Ku Klux Klan” that rose up to rid whites of “the intolerable burden of governments sustained by the votes of ignorant Negroes.”

During Wilson’s tenure as president of Princeton, no blacks were admitted — “The whole temper and tradition of the place are such that no Negro has ever applied,” he wrote — though Harvard and Yale had admitted blacks decades earlier. Princeton admitted its first black student in the 1940s.

At Princeton today, Black Justice League members said they had often felt excluded and continually if subtly called on to justify their presence at one of the nation’s top schools.

They protest the fact that only about 2 percent of the faculty is black (the student body is around 8 percent black).

And for some students, Wilson’s name and image around campus feel like constant reminders that they are not entirely welcome.

“It’s a haunting,” said Ozioma Obi-Onuoha of the Black Justice League, a senior majoring in politics who grew up in North Carolina.

Online, sometimes under the cloak of anonymity, many people mocked the group’s efforts.

“Will the proposed Black Cultural Space have its own water fountain?” a commenter on a Daily Princetonian story asked.

But in the dining hall of Wilson College on Friday, against the backdrop of the Wilson mural, made from a photograph of the president throwing a first pitch at a baseball game, students took the debate seriously.

“I’m a little bit torn,” said Takim Williams, a senior majoring in philosophy who is black. “My race has never been a disadvantage to me — at least that’s how I view it — so I haven’t had the same visceral reaction.”

He said he found the renaming idea “drastic.” His tablemate Calvert Chan, a sophomore who is Asian-American, said, “If the criteria for naming a building for someone was that they’d be perfect, we shouldn’t name buildings.”

Nearby, Amina Simon, who is white and took part in the protests, said Wilson’s name did not belong on a dorm complex “where you’re expected to have residential college spirit and cheer for Wilson College.” For black students, she said, “having to identify yourself with the name of someone who did not build this place for you is unfair.”

Across campus on Friday evening, as she walked out of the soaring atrium of the public policy school, the school’s dean, Cecilia Rouse, who is black, declined to take a position.

“I think we have to look at what it means to change the name of an internationally known school,” she said. “Our alumni are identified with the Woodrow Wilson School, so it’s not an easy decision.”

But she added: “I think it’s an important conversation for our students, for our faculty, for our staff, to really understand the many dimensions of Princeton’s legacy with race. I actually think it’s a very good thing.”

A voice over the intercom delivers the bad news, and throughout the car there are audible sighs.

Your train is delayed because of a sick passenger.

Subway riders sit and wonder: Who is this sick passenger, and why is he or she on my train? Any sympathy for the mysterious person is often mixed with annoyance.

At the same time, an intricate effort unfolds out of sight. The train’s crew alerts the rail control center to send an ambulance to the nearest station. The emergency medical workers rush below ground to locate the patient — often a challenge in more labyrinthine stations.

This process can stretch on for more than half an hour, creating a cascade of delays across the vast system. And so the not-sick passengers wait. And wait. Statistics show they are waiting more than ever these days.

Hold on tight (but wash those hands).New York Today: New York Today: Queasy RiderNOV. 23, 2015
Sick passengers have accounted for about 3,000 train delays each month this year in New York City, a figure that has grown drastically in recent years, up from about 1,800 each month in 2012, according to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The authority alerts riders to the incidents on Twitter, and some have responded by voicing frustration over the disruptions.

Yet despite the frequency of these delays, they remain a persistent riddle for many riders who have no idea what exactly the phrase “sick passenger” means.

Officials at the authority say the incidents often involve riders who have fainted or vomited. Other passengers might have had a heart attack or a seizure, or could be unconscious or even dead. A sick customer is not, as some surmise, a suicide on the tracks, which workers are instructed to announce as a “police investigation.”

The timing and location of a delay can determine how many riders are affected. In September, as crowds of people streamed into the subway after the pope’s visit to Central Park, an A train screeched to a halt just north of West 72nd Street. Someone had pulled the emergency brake in the last car to report that a young woman felt sick.

Nelson Ortiz, the leader of a subway emergency response team stationed nearby in case problems arose during the papal event, told the train crew to proceed to the next express station, at 125th Street. The woman ultimately declined medical help, and the train continued on. But the incident at 6:05 p.m. caused a 13-minute delay in the middle of the evening rush, long enough to delay 11 trains.

In a subway system with as many as six million riders a day and 469 stations, some riders are bound to get sick.

The number of delays caused by sick passengers has fluctuated this year, with an uptick during March and April, statistics show. The authority does not know exactly why.

One Twitter post announced last week, for instance: Northbound “#2 & #5 trains delayed due to a sick customer at E 180 St. Allow additional travel time.”

The other top reasons for delays include overcrowding, equipment problems and bad weather. As the aging system — which first opened more than a century ago — struggles to handle booming ridership, the overall number of train delays has also increased.

After a delay this month on an N train Susie Moy was riding, she took to Twitter to complain, as many riders have — often in angry and colorful language. “Enough with the sick passenger excuse,” she wrote to the authority’s account. “No one buys it!”

Ms. Moy, 25, who lives in Sunset Park in Brooklyn, has noticed more of these delays and wondered whether they were really caused by sick passengers, rather than equipment problems. If more people are falling ill, the authority should have more personnel on hand to help, she said.

“It just doesn’t make sense to delay thousands of people over one sick passenger,” she said in an interview. “There has to be a better way to handle it.”

The response by the authorities depends on the condition of the sick passenger. Workers are instructed not to move riders who cannot walk off the train on their own and to wait for emergency medical workers to assess the patient. If the passenger can step off the train, someone else — a friend, a worker or a police officer — must stay until help arrives. Otherwise, the conductor must stay with the rider, and the train may have to be pulled out of service.

In 2013, Casey Blue James was standing on a crowded train in Queens when she started to feel woozy and fainted. When she awoke, the train was stopped and everyone was staring at her. A transportation authority worker stayed with her at the station until an ambulance arrived to take her to the emergency room.

When Ms. James, 26, who works in publishing and lives in Jackson Heights, Queens, had the same dizzy feeling last year, she shoved her way off the train to avoid embarrassment and fainted on a platform. After being told she had a condition in which her blood pressure can drop rapidly, she now carries water and snacks in her bag.

Before it happened to her, she was annoyed by the delays like everyone else.

“I feel much more sympathetic when I hear that’s the reason now,” she said.

In an ad campaign, the authority has urged riders who feel sick to get off at the next stop to get help — and to alleviate delays. Officials have reminded riders not to pull the emergency brake, which abruptly stops the train, because that can slow the emergency response if the train is stranded between stations.

Starting in the late 1990s, the transportation authority tried to reduce the impact of sick passengers by stationing nurses in a few busy stations. But the program ended around 2008, done in by a budget crunch.

John Rugen, an E.M.T. for the New York Fire Department, has responded to a number of sick riders, including a man who had a seizure this year in Queens. Finding a patient can be challenging, he said, especially at big, busy stations where many lines converge and entry points are spread over a wide area.

Other riders are often impatient, eager to get moving and sometimes oblivious to the condition of the passenger.

“You can’t stop patient care and explain what’s happening,” Mr. Rugen said.

For Gene Russianoff, the longtime leader of the Straphangers Campaign, a rider advocacy group, being a sick passenger taught him that New Yorkers can be remarkably kind. When he once fell forward while on a train and hit the floor, bloodying his nose, people on the train rushed to help.

“It’s the golden rule,” he said. “If you got sick, would you want someone to step over you and say, ‘I’m late to get to Macy’s’?”

n a basement on the Irvine campus of the University of California, behind a series of five protective doors, two teams of biologists have created a novel breed of mosquito that they hope will help eradicate malaria from the world.

FROM OUR ADVERTISERS





The mosquito has been engineered to carry two ingenious genetic modifications. One is a set of genes that spew out antibodies to the malarial parasite harbored by the mosquito. Mosquitoes with these genes are rendered resistant to the parasite and so cannot spread malaria.

The other modification is a set of genetic elements known as a gene drive that should propel the malaria-resistance genes throughout a natural mosquito population. When a malaria-resistant male mosquito mates with a wild female, the gene drive copies both itself and the resistance genes over from the male chromosome to its female counterpart.

Concerns Raised about Genetically Engineered MosquitoesOCT. 30, 2011
Because almost all the progeny carry the new genes, instead of just 50 percent as would be expected by Mendel’s laws of genetics, the inserted genes are expected to spread rapidly and take over a wild population in as few as 10 generations, or a single season. A large region, at least in principle, could be freed from malaria, which kills almost 600,000 people a year.

The anti-malarial antibody genes were developed by a group led by Anthony A. James of the University of California, Irvine, and the gene drive by Valentino M. Gantz and Ethan Bier of the University of California, San Diego. The two teams reported the result of their collaboration in Monday’s issue of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

“This is a very important advance in the field of mosquito biology,” said George Dimopoulos, a biologist at Johns Hopkins who has engineered mosquitoes to resist the malarial parasite with a different set of genes.

Op-Ed Contributor: The Risks of Assisting EvolutionNOV. 10, 2015
Kevin Esvelt, an expert on the gene drive technique at Harvard, said he was delighted with the work of the two teams. “We have a wonderful chance of knocking down malaria and dengue fever and other diseases, so hats off to Tony James, who has been developing these techniques for 15 years,” he said.

The two teams came together after Dr. Gantz and Dr. Bier developed a gene drive for the Drosophila fruit fly, a standard laboratory organism, to help identify genetically mutant insects. Finding their gene drive was far more efficient than expected, driving its cargo genes into almost all the fruit fly progeny, the researchers realized they had created not just a handy laboratory tool but a powerful technique for spreading favored genes through wild populations.

After sending a report of their finding to the journal Science, which published it in April, Dr. Bier started looking around for practical uses for the technique, and came across a 2012 article in which Dr. James described making mosquitoes resistant to the malarial parasite. Dr. James concluded his paper by noting that “if coupled with a mechanism for gene spread,” his resistance genes “could become a self-sustaining disease control tool.” Having developed just such a mechanism, Dr. Bier called Dr. James to propose a collaboration.


It took Dr. Valentino about two months to load all the necessary genetic elements onto a plasmid, a viruslike circle of DNA that genetic engineers use to insert genes into chromosomes. Some 680 wild mosquito larvae were injected with the cargo-carrying plasmid. About half grew to adults, which were mated with wild mosquitoes, and the progeny were then screened to see if the injected plasmids had successfully found their way to the eggs or sperm of the original larvae.

To help track the progress of the experiment, Dr. Gantz engineered a color marker into the plasmid’s cargo, a gene that turned the mosquitoes’ eyes red. Thus the appearance of red-eyed mosquitoes would mean the drive and its cargo had successfully been inherited.

Olga Tatarenkova, a member of Dr. James’s team, picked up the task of screening 25,000 mosquito larvae. One Saturday morning in July, she found two larvae with red eyes. After checking with other members to verify her finding, she emailed Dr. James to tell him the good news.

Dr. James, Dr. Gantz and Dr. Bier plan to refine the mosquitoes’ genetics and conduct trials in cages. He hopes that eventually scientists in some country where malaria is endemic will invite them to conduct a field trial and will monitor it carefully to make sure there are no adverse affects, even though it’s hard to see any ecological downside to protecting the mosquitoes against the malarial parasite.

Dr. Dimopoulos, who has engineered mosquitoes to rev up their immune systems and reject the malaria parasite, plans to add a gene drive as Dr. James has done, and to seek the Zambian government’s approval for a trial in a large, greenhouselike enclosure he operates in southern Zambia.

Rendering the wild mosquito population immune to the malaria parasite may seem a fairly minimal and benign intervention. But no gene drives have yet been released into the wild, and biologists are keen to avoid surprises that might arouse public hostility to the novel technology.

A more likely mishap is that the gene drive and its cargo genes will start to develop mutations that impair their inheritance or that natural selection will favor other genes that overwhelm them. The biologists could respond by developing new gene drives and cargoes, but the process could become uneconomical, in which case the new approach would fail or offer just partial advantages.

Dr. James plans to proceed in careful stages with the knowledge and approval of local authorities. “This is the kind of technology where the first trial has to be a success,” he said.

The agricultural revolution was one of the most profound events in human history, leading to the rise of modern civilization. Now, in the first study of its kind, an international team of scientists has found that after agriculture arrived in Europe 8,500 years ago, people’s DNA underwent widespread changes, altering their height, digestion, immune system and skin color.

Researchers had found indirect clues of some of these alterations by studying the genomes of living Europeans. But the new study, they said, makes it possible to see the changes as they occurred over thousands of years.

“For decades we’ve been trying to figure out what happened in the past,” said Rasmus Nielsen, a geneticist at the University of California, Berkeley, who was not involved in the new study. “And now we have a time machine.”

Before the advent of studies of ancient DNA, scientists had relied mainly on bones and other physical remains to understand European history. The earliest bones of modern humans in Europe date to about 45,000 years ago, researchers have found.

Early Europeans lived as hunter-gatherers for over 35,000 years. About 8,500 years ago, farmers left their first mark in the archaeological record of the continent.

By studying living Europeans, scientists had already found evidence suggesting that their ancestors adapted to agriculture through natural selection. As tools to sequence DNA became more readily available, researchers even discovered some of the molecular underpinnings of these traits.

But these studies couldn’t help determine exactly when the changes occurred, or whether they resulted from natural selection or the migrations of people into Europe from other regions.

Scientists are now tackling these questions in a much more direct way, thanks to a rapidly growing supply of DNA from ancient skeletons. These studies have revealed that the DNA of Europeans today comes from three main sources.

Before the rise of agriculture, Europe was home to a population of hunter-gatherers. Then a wave of people arrived whose DNA resembles that of people in the Near East. It’s likely that they brought agriculture with them.

Groundbreaking laws in two Western states will soon make access to birth control easier for millions of women by allowing them to obtain contraceptives from pharmacists without a doctor’s prescription.

FROM OUR ADVERTISERS





Even as the Supreme Court prepares to consider another divisive case involving access to contraception, public health advocates hope these arrangements could spread across the country, as states grappling with persistently high rates of unintended pregnancy seek to increase access to birth control with measures that so far have been unavailable under federal law.

Most Western countries require a doctor’s prescription for hormonal contraceptives like pills, patches and rings, but starting sometime in the next few months, women in California and Oregon will be able to obtain these types of birth control by getting a prescription directly from the pharmacist who dispenses them, a more convenient and potentially less expensive option than going to the doctor.

The laws are the latest effort to make birth control more accessible, a longstanding goal of medical professionals and policy makers. But unlike other recent debates over contraception — including the firestorm over the Obama administration’s requirement under the Affordable Care Act that all health plans pay for contraceptives — these legislative efforts have been largely free of political rancor.

“I feel strongly that this is what’s best for women’s health in the 21st century, and I also feel it will have repercussions for decreasing poverty because one of the key things for women in poverty is unintended pregnancy,” said State Representative Knute Buehler, a Republican who sponsored Oregon’s law.

About half of the 6.6 million pregnancies annually in the United States are unintended, a higher proportion than in Europe.

Reproductive health groups and medical associations increasingly say the ultimate goal should be to make contraceptives available without a prescription, and some worry that the push for pharmacist-prescribed contraceptives could thwart that. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists is one of the few groups to express opposition to these laws, arguing that hormonal contraceptives should be available solely over the counter.

“My basic tenet is there should be nobody between the patient and the pill,” said Dr. Mark DeFrancesco, the president of the organization. “I’m afraid we’re going to create a new model that becomes a barrier between that and over the counter. I worry that it’s going to derail the over-the-counter movement.”

But supporters of over-the-counter contraceptives acknowledge that getting Food and Drug Administration approval could take a long time because the agency often requires additional studies.

Cost is another possible drawback of over-the-counter sales. The Affordable Care Act does not explicitly require plans to cover over-the-counter medications, so women might wind up paying hundreds of dollars a year for over-the-counter birth control instead of obtaining it free with a prescription.

A bill introduced in Congress in May by Republican senators would help expedite the process in which contraceptive manufacturers apply to the Food and Drug Administration for over-the-counter approval, but some Democrats and women’s groups say it might ultimately reduce birth control use because it does not specify insurance coverage for over-the-counter methods. In response, Democrats have introduced a bill stipulating that contraceptives would remain covered if they were to become available without a prescription.

In the absence of federal action, states are stepping in.

Jill Vincik, a high school teacher who recently moved to Bend, Ore., said that being able to get her birth control pills without a doctor’s appointment would make her life easier.

“I would certainly take advantage of it,” said Ms. Vincik, 37, a single mother, who noted that she had a gynecological exam before moving and had not yet found a gynecologist in Oregon. “I shouldn’t be in a position to have to go to a doctor when my pills run out. I’m not going to do another Pap smear; I just did one.”

Advocates of this approach, including pharmacists’ organizations, plan to lobby for it across the country. “We are actively going to come up with a statute to spread to other states, and I think it can spread pretty quickly,” said Mr. Buehler, the Oregon legislator, who is also an orthopedist. Pharmacy board representatives from states including Arizona and Idaho observed a recent meeting in Oregon about the new rules.

A New Mexico proposal that failed in 2012 is expected to be revised to reflect the Oregon and California measures, said Dale Tinker, the executive director of the New Mexico Pharmacists Association. Raley’s, a grocery store and pharmacy chain with 80 stores in Northern California and 16 in Nevada, is urging Nevada to follow California’s lead, said Lee Worthy, the chain’s vice president for pharmacy and wellness.

“It’s going to take a lot of the barriers away from that underserved community that we see surrounding every store,” Mr. Worthy said.

Many reproductive health experts have come to support pharmacist-prescribed contraceptives, persuaded that pharmacists can safely dispense contraception without a doctor’s prescription and that women can assess their health risks on questionnaires.

“There’s a growing body of evidence that there isn’t a safety concern,” said Dr. Daniel Grossman, vice president for research at Ibis Reproductive Health and a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, San Francisco. “There are studies showing that women can really accurately identify the conditions that make it appropriate to use certain contraceptives, using a simple checklist.”

Some people have argued that a need for contraception brings women to the doctor, ensuring that they get other important screening tests, like Pap smears to detect cervical cancer. But Dr. Nancy Stanwood, an obstetrician and chairwoman of the board of Physicians for Reproductive Health, said a study of Texas women who received over-the-counter contraceptives in Mexico had found that many still visited doctors for Pap smears. And she noted that Pap smears were now recommended every three years, not annually, and not until women turn 21.

“We were holding pregnancy prevention hostage to cancer screening,” Dr. Stanwood said. “They’re both worthwhile goals, but one should not be held hostage to the other.”

The new laws are extensions of arrangements now found in almost every state: collaborative practice laws that allow pharmacists to administer vaccines or prescribe certain medications if they have agreements with physicians or other health providers. The laws vary widely, and some include only specific diseases or drugs. But in some places, like Washington State and Washington, D.C., collaborative practice laws are broad enough for pharmacists to prescribe birth control if their physician agreements permit it.

In Seattle, Beverly Schaefer, a co-owner of Katterman’s Sand Point Pharmacy, has a physician’s permission to prescribe various medications, including antibiotics and antihistamines. She charges a $35 fee, and will prescribe hormonal contraceptives for women who say they have previously been prescribed them.

So far, those customers have typically been college students who “haven’t planned ahead and are like, ‘Oh, my god, I don’t have any contraceptives,’” she said. “I also see it in some ways as being more comfortable for women because it is a less clinical environment.”

But arrangements like this have been sporadic, experts say, because arranging physician agreements can be time-consuming, and women often do not know which pharmacies have them.

One unanswered question, however, is whether insurers will pay for the time pharmacists spend reviewing women’s questionnaires or helping evaluate options. To cover that cost, some pharmacists may charge fees of $25 or more, which could be an obstacle for some women.

The laws in Oregon and California differ in some ways. California’s has no age restriction; the Oregon law requires that teenagers under 18 obtain their first contraceptive prescription from a doctor. In California, pharmacists will also most likely have to take women’s blood pressure for contraceptives containing estrogen.

Dr. Stanwood of Physicians for Reproductive Health described these states as “incubators, which may end up being a model at the national level.”

She said, “We need to think outside of that old-fashioned box that just doesn’t apply to women’s lives now.”

Weather-related disasters in the past two decades have killed more than 600,000 people and inflicted economic losses estimated at trillions of dollars, the United Nations said on Monday, warning that the frequency and impact of such events was set to rise.

The figures were released before a United Nations-backed climate meeting, starting next Monday in Paris, at which more than 120 national leaders will try to rein in greenhouse gas emissions and slow the rise in global temperatures.

According to the report from the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, the United States has suffered the highest number of weather-related disasters in the past two decades, but China and India have been the most severely affected, enduring floods that had an impact on billions of people.

As well as killing hundreds of thousands, weather-related disasters wounded 4.1 billion others and inflicted economic costs well in excess of $1.9 trillion over the two decades, the report found.

“Predictions of more extreme weather in the future almost certainly means that we will witness a continued upward trend in weather-related disasters in the decades ahead,” the report said.

In a foreword to the findings, Margareta Wahlstrom, the head of the disaster reduction office, said the findings “underline why it is so important that a new climate change agreement emerges” from the summit meeting in Paris.

Citing the rising temperature of the oceans and melting glaciers as two central drivers of extreme weather, Ms. Wahlstrom said that agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions would help reduce the huge damage and losses inflicted by disasters linked to climate.

The connection between extreme weather and climate change is not always clear. There is strong evidence that the warming climate is creating more frequent and intense heat waves, causing heavier rainstorms, worsening coastal flooding and intensifying some droughts, but for many other types of weather occurrences, the linkage is less clear.

Floods accounted for close to half of all the weather-related disasters, affecting 2.3 billion people, mostly in Asia, the report found. Storms had taken the heaviest toll of lives, however, causing about 242,000 recorded deaths, including 138,000 killed by Cyclone Nargis, which struck Myanmar in 2008.

Droughts, most acute in Africa, had affected more than a billion people in the past two decades, leading not only to hunger, malnutrition and disease but also to widespread agricultural failure that resulted in long-lasting underdevelopment, the report said.

Heat waves had killed 148,000, mostly in Europe, and wildfires had emerged as another climate-related risk, according to the report. About 38 major wildfires in the United States were estimated to have affected more than 108,000 people and caused recorded losses of over $11 billion — numbers the report said were sure to rise when fires that were raging after August 2015, the cutoff point for data, were taken into account.

The figure of $1.9 trillion for the worldwide cost of the disasters was drawn up for the United Nations by the Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters, based in Belgium. The center said that figure was a minimum, however, as data was available for only a little more than a third of the recorded disasters.

The N.F.L. has often trumpeted its increased efforts to spot and treat concussions, including allowing a medical spotter to call a timeout this season if a potential injury is missed by on-field staff.

But the concussion sustained by St. Louis Rams quarterback Case Keenum on Sunday has fans wondering whether the league’s system is working as designed.

With just over a minute remaining in regulation time and the score tied, 13-13, against the Baltimore Ravens, Keenum dropped back to pass and was thrown to the ground after releasing the ball. The back of Keenum’s head slammed against the turf. He immediately put both of his hands on his helmet. Then he tried to get up, wobbled and fell back down. Clearly dazed, Keenum was helped to his feet by a teammate.

The Rams sent their trainer onto the field to look at Keenum, who stayed in the game. Two plays later, Keenum was sacked, and fumbled. The Ravens then moved downfield and kicked a winning field goal.

Only after the game did the Rams give Keenum a test to see if he sustained a concussion, which he did. The Rams did not explain why he was not taken out of the game. Coach Jeff Fisher was not asked about the hit in his postgame news conference, though he essentially said the team’s offensive line played poorly.

Fisher said he expected Keenum to play on Sunday, but that was before he learned that his quarterback had been concussed.

Fisher will speak to the news media on Monday at 5 p.m. Central time.

Brian McCarthy, an N.F.L. spokesman, said in a statement that immediately after the game, the league began a review to determine why Keenum “was not removed from the game for the necessary evaluation by a team physician or unaffiliated neuro-trauma consultant as required by our concussion protocols.”

League officials are talking to the Rams and their medical staff, the spotter at the game, the referees, N.F.L. medical advisers and the players’ union.

“In the meantime, prior to this week’s games, we will reinforce with all involved the need to ensure that these injuries are properly identified and addressed in a manner consistent with our protocols,” the league said.

McCarthy said a league spotter can ask for a timeout to be called when a trainer has not come onto the field. In this case, the Rams sent their trainer out to look at Keenum. Why he was left in the game is a question yet to be answered.

Fans and sports commenters seemed to have made up their minds. Bernie Miklasz, a longtime St. Louis sportswriter and radio host, spoke for many of the hundreds of commenters online when he called the oversight “disgraceful.”

“This wasn’t a case of a player being able to cover up his injury — hoping no one witnessed it — so he could stay in the game,” he wrote. “This still happens too often in the N.F.L., even after the league’s initiative to be on full alert to look for signs of a concussion.”

The hit to Keenum comes less than two weeks after the Rams signed wide receiver Wes Welker, who has suffered several documented concussions in his 12-year career, including three in a nine-month period. Fisher said he had no concerns about Welker’s condition, and Welker, 34, brushed off skeptics.

“I’m really now worried about it,” he said, adding that he played last season without suffering a head injury. “I know I’m a poster child right now and everything else. I’m good and ready to play some ball.”
