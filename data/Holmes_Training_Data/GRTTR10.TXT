Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $4
million dollars per hour this year as we release some eight text
files per month:  thus upping our productivity from $2 million.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is 10% of the expected number of computer users by the end
of the year 2001.

CHAPTER I

THE FAMILY AND EARLY WARS OF ONUND THE SON OF OFEIG

There was a man named Onund, the son of Ofeig Clumsyfoot, who was
the son of Ivar Horsetail.  Onund was the brother of Gudbjorg,
the mother of Gudbrand Knob, the father of Asta, the mother of
King Olaf the Saint.  His mother came from the Upplands, while
his father's relations were mostly in Rogaland and Hordland.  He
was a great viking and used to harry away in the West over the
sea.  He was accompanied on these expeditions by one Balki, the
son of Blaeing from Sotanes, and by Orm the Wealthy.  Another
comrade of theirs was named Hallvard.  They had five ships, all
well equipped.  They plundered the Hebrides, reaching the Barra
Isles, where there ruled a king named Kjarval, who also had five
ships.  These they attacked; there was a fierce battle between
them, in which Onund's men fought with the utmost bravery.  After
many had fallen on both sides, the battle ended with the king
taking to flight with a single ship; the rest were captured by
Onund's force, along with much booty.  They stayed there for the
winter, and spent the succeeding three summers harrying the
coasts of Ireland and Scotland, after which they returned to
Norway.


CHAPTER II

THE BATTLE OF HAFRSFJORD

At that time Norway was very disturbed.  Harald Shockhead, the
son of Halfdan the Black, till then king of the Upplands, was
aiming at the supreme kingship.  He went into the North and
fought many battles there, in which he was always victorious. 
Then he marched harrying through the territories to the South,
bringing them into subjection wherever he came.  On reaching
Hordland he was opposed by a motley multitude led by Kjotvi the
Wealthy, Thorir Long-chin, and Soti and King Sulki from South
Rogaland.  Geirmund Swarthyskin was then away in the West, beyond
the sea, so he was not present at the battle, although Hordland
belonged to his dominion.

Onund and his party had arrived that autumn from the western
seas, and when Thorir and Kjotvi heard of their landing they sent
envoys to ask for their aid, promising to treat them with honour.

They were very anxious for an opportunity of distinguishing
themselves, so they joined Thorir's forces, and declared that
they would be in the thickest part of the battle.  They met King
Harald in a fjord in Rogaland called Hafrsfjord.  The forces on
each side were very large, and the battle was one of the greatest
ever fought in Norway.  There are many accounts of it, for one
always hears much about those people of whom the saga is told. 
Troops had come in from all the country around and from other
countries as well, besides a multitude of vikings.  Onund brought
his ship alongside of that of Thorir Long-chin in the very middle
of the battle.  King Harald made for Thorir's ship, knowing him
to be a terrible berserk, and very brave.  The fighting was
desperate on either side.  Then the king ordered his berserks,
the men called Wolfskins, forward.  No iron could hurt them, and
when they charged nothing could withstand them.  Thorir defended
himself bravely and fell on his ship fighting valiantly.  The
whole ship from stem to stern was cleared and her fastenings were
cut, so that she fell out of the line of battle.  Then they
attacked Onund's ship, in the forepart of which he was standing
and fighting manfully.  The king's men said: "He bears himself
well in the forecastle.  Let us give him something to remind him
of having been in the battle."  Onund was stepping out with one
foot on to the bulwark, and as he was striking they made a thrust
at him with a spear; in parrying it he bent backwards, and at
that moment a man on the forecastle of the king's ship struck him
and took off his leg below the knee, disabling him at a blow. 
With him fell the greater number of his men.  They carried him to
a ship belonging to a man named Thrand, a son of Bjorn and
brother of Eyvind the Easterner.  He was fighting against King
Harald, and his ship was lying on the other side of Onund's. 
Then there was a general flight.  Thrand and the rest of the
vikings escaped any way they could, and sailed away westwards. 
They took with them Onund and Balki and Hallvard Sugandi.  Onund
recovered and went about for the rest of his life with a wooden
leg, wherefore he was called Onund Treefoot as long as he lived.


CHAPTER III

MEETING OF DEFEATED CHIEFS IN THE WEST AND MARRIAGE OF ONUND

There were then in the western parts many distinguished men who
had fled from their homes in Norway before King Harald, for he
declared all who fought against him outlaws, and seized their
property.  As soon as Onund had recovered from his wound, Thrand
went with his party to Geirmund Swarthyskin, who was the most
eminent of the vikings in the West.  They asked him whether he
was not going to try and regain his kingdom in Hordland, and
offered to join him, hoping by this means to do something for
their own properties, for Onund was very wealthy and his kindred
very powerful.  Geirmund answered that Harald had such a force
that there was little hope of gaining any honour by fighting when
the whole country had joined against him and been beaten.  He had
no mind, he said, to become the king's thrall, and to beg for
that which he had once possessed in his own right.  Seeing that
he was no longer in the vigour of his youth he preferred to find
some other occupation.  So Onund and his party returned to the
Southern Islands, where they met many of their friends.

There was a man named Ofeig, nicknamed Grettir.  He was the son
of Einar, the son of Olvir the Babyman.  He was a brother of
Oleif the Broad, the father of Thormod Shaft.  Another son of
Olvir was named Steinolf, the father of Una, whom Thorbjorn the
Salmon-man married.  A third son of Olvir was Steinmod, who was
the father of Konal, the father of Alfdis of the Barra Isles. 
Konal's son was named Steimnod; he was the father of Halldora,
whom Eilif, the son of Ketil the One-handed, married.

Ofeig Grettir married Asny, the daughter of Vestar, the son of
Haeing.  His sons were Asmund the Beardless and Asbjorn, and his
daughters were named Aldis, Aesa, and Asvor.  Ofeig had fled from
the wrath of King Harald into the West over the sea, along with
his kinsman Thormod Shaft and all their families.  They ravaged
far and wide in the western seas.  Thrand and Onund Treefoot were
going West to Ireland to join Thrand's brother, Eyvind the
Easterner, who had command of the Irish defences.  Eyvind's
mother was named Hlif; she was the daughter of Hrolf, the son of
Ingjald, the son of King Frodi, while Thrand's mother was Helga,
the daughter of Ondott Crow.  The father of Eyvind and Thrand was
Bjorn, the son of Hrolf of Ar.  He had had to leave Gautland
because he had burnt in his house Sigfast the father-in-law of
King Solvi.  Then he went to Norway and spent the winter with
Grim the Hersir, a son of Kolbjorn the Sneak, who wanted to
murder him for his money.  Thence Bjorn went to Ondott Crow, who
lived in Hvinisfjord in Agdir.  There he was well received,
stayed the winter, and went campaigning with Ondott in the summer
until his wife Hlif died.  Eventually Ondott gave Bjorn his
daughter Helga, and Bjorn then no longer went out to fight. 
Eyvind had taken over his father's ships and become a great chief
in the western parts.  He married Rafarta, the daughter of the
Irish king Kjarval.  Their sons were Helgi the Lean and
Snaebjorn.

When Thrand and Onund came to the Southern Islands they found
there Ofeig Grettir and Thormod Shaft, with whom they became very
friendly, for each thought the others had risen from the dead,
their last meeting having been in Norway when the war was at its
worst.  Onund was very silent, and Thrand, when he noticed it,
asked what was on his mind.  Onund answered with a verse:

     "No joy is mine since in battle I fought.
     Many the sorrows that o'er me lower.
     Men hold me for nought; this thought is the worst
     of all that oppresses my sorrowing heart."

Thrand said: "Why, you still seem as full of vigour as ever you
were.  You may yet settle down and marry.  You shall have my good
word and my interest if you will only tell me whom you fancy."

Onund said he behaved nobly; but said there had once been a time
when his chances of making a profitable marriage had been better.

Thrand said: "Ofeig has a daughter named Aesa; we might mention
it if you like."

Onund said he would like it, and soon afterwards Ofeig was
approached on the subject.  He received the proposal favourably,
saying he knew the man to be of good lineage and to have some
wealth in movable property, though his lands were not worth
much.  "But," he said, "I do not think he is very wise.  Why,
my daughter is quite a child."

Thrand said that Onund was more vigorous than many a man whose
legs were sounder.

So with the aid of Thrand the terms were settled.  Ofeig was to
give his daughter a portion in cash, for neither would reckon
anything for his lands in Norway.  Soon afterwards Thrand was
betrothed to the daughter of Thormod Shaft.  Both the maids were
to remain plighted for three years.

Then they went on fighting expeditions in the summer, remaining
in the Barra Isles during the winter.


CHAPTER IV

FIGHT WITH VIKINGS VIGBJOD AND VESTMAR

There were two Vikings from the Southern Isles, named Vigbjod and
Vestmar; they were abroad both summer and winter.  They had eight
ships, and harried mostly round the coast of Ireland, where they
did many an evil deed until Eyvind undertook the defence of the
coast, when they retired to the Hebrides to harry there, and
right in to the Scotch firths.  Thrand and Onund went out against
them and learned that they had sailed to an island called Bot. 
Onund and Thrand followed them thither with five ships, and when
the vikings sighted them and saw how many there were, they
thought their own force was sufficient, so they took to their
arms and advanced to the attack.  Onund ordered his ships to take
up a position between two rocks where there was a deep but narrow
channel, open to attack from one side only, and by not more than
five ships at once.  Onund was a very wily man.  He sent his five
ships forward into the channel so that, as there was plenty of
sea room behind them, they could easily retire by merely backing
their oars.  One ship he brought under an island lying on their
beam, and carried a great stone to a place on the front of the
rock where it could not be seen from the enemy's ships.  The
Vikings came boldly on, thinking they had caught them in a trap. 
Vigbjod asked who they were that he had hemmed in.  Thrand
answered that he was a brother of Eyvind the Easterner, and the
man with him was his comrade, Onund Treefoot.  The vikings
laughed and said:

     "Trolls take the rascal Treefoot
     and lay him even with the ground.

Never yet did I see men go to battle who could not carry
themselves."

Onund said that could not be known until it was tried.  Then the
ships came together.  There was a great battle in which both
sides fought bravely.  When the battle was thick Onund ordered
his ships to back their oars.  The vikings seeing it thought they
were taking to flight, and pushed on with all their might, coming
under the rock just at the moment when the party which had been
dispatched for that purpose arrived.  They launched upon the
vikings stones so huge that nothing could hold against them.  A
number of the vikings were killed, and others were so injured
that they could fight no more.  Then the vikings tried to escape,
but could not, as their ships were in the narrowest part of the
channel and were impeded both by the current and by the enemy's
ships.  Onund's men vigorously attacked the wing commanded by
Vigbjod while Thrand engaged Vestmar, but effected little.  When
the men on Vigbjod's ship had been somewhat reduced, Onund's men,
he himself with them, prepared to board her.  On seeing that,
Vigbjod spurred on his men resolutely.  He turned against Onund,
most of whose men gave way.  Onund was a man of immense strength
and he bade his followers observe how it fared with them.  They
shoved a log under the stump of his leg, so that he stood pretty
firm.  The viking dashed forward, reached Onund and hewed at him
with his sword, which cut right through his shield and into the
log beneath his leg, where it remained fixed.  As Vigbjod bent
down to pull his sword clear again, Onund dealt him a blow on his
shoulder, severing his arm and disabling him.  When Vestmar saw
his comrade fall, he sprang on to the outermost ship and escaped
along with all who could get on to her.  Then they examined the
dead.  Vigbjod had already expired.  Onund went up to him and
said:

     "Bloody thy wounds.  Didst thou see me flee?
     'One-leg' no hurt received from thee.
     Braver are many in word than in deed.
     Thou, slave, didst fail when it came to the trial."

They took a large quantity of booty and returned to the Barra
Isles in the autumn.

CHAPTER V

VISIT OF ONUND AND THRAND TO EYVIND IN IRELAND

The following summer they made ready for a voyage to the West, to
Ireland.  At the same time Balki and Hallvard sailed westwards,
to Iceland, where they had heard that good land was available for
occupation.  Balki took up some land at Hrutafjord, and had his
abode in two places called Balkastad.  Hallvard occupied
Sugandafjord and Skalavik as far as Stigi, where he lived.

Thrand and Onund went to visit Eyvind the Easterner, who
welcomed joyfully his brother Thrand; but when he heard that
Onund had also come, he became very angry and wanted to fight
him.  Thrand asked him not to do so, and said it would ill become
him to quarrel with men from Norway, especially with such as had
given no offence.  Eyvind said that he had given offence before,
when he made war on Kjarval the king, and that he should now pay
for it.  The brothers had much to say to each other about the
matter, till at last Thrand said that he and Onund should share
their fortune together.  Then Eyvind allowed himself to be
appeased.  They stayed there a long time in the summer and went
with Eyvind on his expeditions.  Eyvind found Onund to be a man
of the greatest valour.  In the autumn they went to the Hebrides,
and Eyvind made over to Thrand all his share in their father
Bjorn's patrimony in the event of Bjorn dying before Thrand. 
They stayed in the Hebrides until they married and some years
after.


CHAPTER VI

DEATH OF BJORN; DISPUTES OVER HIS PROPERTY IN NORWAY

The next thing that happened was the death of Thrand's father
Bjorn.  When the news of it reached Grim the Hersir he proceeded
against Ondott Crow and claimed Bjorn's estate.  Ondott held
Thrand to be the rightful heir of his father, but Grim contended
that Thrand was away in the West.  Bjorn, he said, came from
Gautland, and the succession to the estate of all foreigners
passed to the king.  Ondott said that he would hold the property
on behalf of Thrand, who was his daughter's son.  Grim then
departed, having effected nothing by his claim.

Thrand, when he heard of his father's death, prepared to leave
the Hebrides, and Onund Treefoot decided to go with him.  Ofeig
Grettir and Thormod Shaft went to Iceland with all their
belongings, landing at Eyrar in the South.  They spent the first
winter with Thorbjorn the Salmon-man, and then occupied
Gnupverjahrepp.  Ofeig took the outer part lying between the
rivers Thvera and Kalfa, and lived at Ofeigsstad near Steinsholt,
while Thormod took the eastern part, living at Skaptaholt. 
Thormod's daughters were named Thorvor and Thorve; the former
afterwards became the mother of Thorodd the Godi at Hjalli,
Thorve of Thorstein the Godi the father of Bjarni the Wise.

We now return to Thrand and Onund, who sailed back from the West
to Norway.  A strong wind blew in their favour, so that they
arrived at the house of Ondott Crow before any one knew of
their journey.  He welcomed Thrand and told him of the claim
which Grim the Hersir had raised for Bjorn's estate.

"To my thinking, kinsman," he said, "it is better that the
property should go to you than to the king's thralls.  It is a
fortunate thing for you that no one knows of your having come
here, for I expect that Grim will make an attack upon one or the
other of us if he can.  I should prefer if you would take over
your property and stay in other countries."

Thrand said that he would do so.  He took over the property and
prepared to leave Norway.  Before leaving he asked Onund Treefoot
whether he would not come to Iceland.  Onund said he wanted first
to visit some of his relations and friends in the South.

"Then," said Thrand, "we must part.  I should be glad if you
would give my kinsmen your support, for our enemies will
certainly try to take revenge upon them when I am gone.  I am
going to Iceland, and I want you to come there too."

Onund said he would come, and they parted with great friendship. 
Thrand went to Iceland, where he met with a welcome from Ofeig
and Thormod Shaft.  He took up his dwelling at Thrandarholt to
the west of Thjorsa.


CHAPTER VII

MURDER OF ONDOTT CROW, AND THE VENGEANCE THEREFOR

Onund went to Rogaland in the South and visited many of his
relations and friends.  He lived there in concealment with a man
named Kolbeinn.  He there learned that King Harald had taken all
his property and given it into the charge of a man named Harekr,
one of his officials.  Onund went by night to Harekr's house and
caught him at home; he was led to execution.  Then Onund took
possession of all the loose property which he found and burnt the
building.

That autumn Grim the Hersir murdered Ondott Crow because he had
not succeeded in getting the property for the king.  Ondott's
wife Signy carried off all their loose property that same night
to a ship and escaped with her sons Asmund and Asgrim to her
father Sighvat.  A little later she sent her sons to Hedin, her
foster-father in Soknadal, where they remained for a time and
then wanted to return to their mother.  They left at last, and at
Yule-tide came to Ingjald the Trusty at Hvin.  His wife Gyda
persuaded him to take them in, and they spent the winter there. 
In the spring Onund came to northern Agdir, having learned of the
murder of Ondott.  He met Signy and asked her what assistance
they would have of him.  She said they were most anxious to
punish Grim for the death of Ondott.  So the sons were sent for,
and when they met Onund Treefoot they all joined together and had
Grim's doings closely watched.

In the summer there was a beer-brewing at Grim's for a jarl named
Audun, whom he had invited.  When Onund and the sons of Ondott
heard of it, they appeared at his house unexpectedly and set fire
to it.  Grim the Hersir and about thirty men were burnt in the
house.  They captured a quantity of valuables.  Then Onund went
into the forest, while the two brothers took the boat of their
foster-father Ingjald, rowed away and lay in hiding a little way
off.  Soon jarl Audun appeared, on his way to the feast, as had
been arranged, but on arriving he missed his host.  So he
collected his men around him and stayed there a few nights, quite
unaware of Onund and his companions.  He slept in a loft with two
other men.  Onund knew everything that was going on in the house
and sent for the two brothers to come to him.  On their arrival
he asked them whether they preferred to keep watch on the house
or to attack the jarl.  They chose to attack.  They then battered
the entrance of the loft with beams until the door gave way. 
Asmund seized the two men who were with the jarl and threw them
to the ground with such violence that they were we11-nigh killed.

Asgrim rushed at the jarl and demanded of him weregild for his
father, for he had been in league with Grim and took part in the
attack when Ondott was murdered.  The jarl said he had no money
about him and asked for time.  Asgrim then placed the point of
his spear against his breast and ordered him to pay up on the
spot.  Then the jarl took a necklace from his neck and gave it to
him with three gold rings and a velvet mantle.  Asgrim took the
things and bestowed a name upon the jarl.  He called him Audun
Nannygoat.

When the farmers and people about heard of the disturbances they
all came out to help the jar].  Onund had a large force with him,
and there was a great battle in which many a good farmer and many
a follower of the jarl were slain.  The brothers returned to
Onund and reported what had occurred with the jarl.  Onund said
it was a pity they had not killed him.  It would, he said, have
been something to make up for the losses which he had suffered
from King Harald.  They said the disgrace was far worse for the
jarl as it was, and they went off to Surnadal to Eirik Beery, a
Landman there, who took them all in for the winter.  At Yule-tide
they had a great drinking bout with a man named Hallsteinn,
nicknamed Stallion.  Eirik opened the feast and entertained them
generously.  Then it was Hallsteinn's turn, and they began to
quarrel.  Hallsteinn struck Eirik with a deer's horn, for which
Eirik got no revenge, but had to go home with it, to the great
annoyance of Ondott's sons.  A little later Asgrim went to
Hallsteinn's house and gave him a severe wound.  All the people
who were present started up and attacked Asgrim.  He defended
himself vigorously and escaped in the dark, leaving them under
the belief that they had killed him.  Onund and Asmund, on
hearing that Asgrim had been killed, were at a loss what they
could do in the matter.  Eirik's advice was that they should
betake themselves to Iceland, for it would never do for them to
remain in the land where the king could get at them.  This they
determined to do.  Each of them had his own ship and they made
ready for the voyage to Iceland.  Hallsteinn was laid low with
his wound and died before Onund sailed with his party.  Kolbeinn,
the man who was mentioned before, went in the ship with Onund.


CHAPTER VIII

ONUND AND ASMUND SAIL TO ICELAND

Onund and Asmund set sail directly when they were ready and their
ships kept together.  Onund said:

     "Hallvard and I were aforetime deemed
     worthy in storm of swords to bear us.
     With one foot now I step on the ship
     towards Iceland.  The poet's day is o'er."

They had a rough passage with cross winds, mostly from the south,
so that they drifted away to the north.  They made Iceland right
in the North, at Langanes, where they regained their reckonings. 
The ships were near enough to each other for them to speak
together.  Asmund said they had better make for Eyjafjord, and
this was agreed to.  They kept under the land and heavy weather
set in from the south-east.  Just as Onund was tacking, the yard
was carried away; they lowered the sail and were driven out to
sea.  Asmund got under the lee of Hrisey, where he waited until a
fair wind set in which took him up to Eyjafjord.  Helgi the Lean
gave him the whole of Kraeklingahlid, and he lived at South-
Glera.  A few years later his brother Asgrim came to Iceland and
took up his residence at North-Glera.  His son was Ellidagrim the
father of Asgrim.


CHAPTER IX

ONUND SETTLES IN KALDBAK

Onund Treefoot was driven away from the shore for several days,
after which the wind shifted and blew towards the land.  Then
they made land again, which those of them who had been there
before recognised as the western coast of the Skagi peninsula. 
They sailed in to Strandafloi, almost to Sudrstrandir.  There
came rowing towards them a ten-oared boat with six men on board,
who hailed the sea-going ship and asked who was their captain. 
Onund told them his name and asked whence they came.  They said
they were the men of Thorvald from Drangar.  Then Onund asked
whether all the land round that coast was occupied; they answered
there was very little left at Sudrstrandir and none at all in the
North.  So Onund asked his men whether they would seek some land
further to the West or take that of which they had just been
told.  They said they would first explore a little further.  They
sailed in along the coast of the bay and anchored off a creek
near Arnes, where they put off in a boat to the shore.

Here dwelt a wealthy man named Eirik Snare, who had taken the
land between Ingolfsfjord and Ofaera in Veidileysa.  On hearing
that Onund had arrived in those parts, he offered to let him have
such portion as he needed from his own lands, adding that there
was little land which had not already been taken up.  Onund said
he would first like to see what there was.

Then they went further into the bay past some fjords and came to
Ofaera, where Eirik said: "Here is what there is to see.  From
here down to the lands of Bjorn is unoccupied."  A high range of
mountains, on which snow had fallen, rose from beside the river. 
Onund looked at the mountains and spoke a verse:

     "My lands and my might have drifted away
       as drifts the ship on the ocean.
     My friends and my home I have left behind me,
       and bartered my acres for Kaldbak."

"Many a man," answered Eirik,  "has lost so much in Norway that
it may not be mended.  I expect too that nearly all the lands in
the main districts have been taken, so that I will not urge you
to leave these parts and seek elsewhere.  I will keep to my word
and let you have whatever lands of my own you may require."

Onund said he would take advantage of his offer, and in the end
he took some of the Ofaera land and the three creeks Byrgisvik,
Kolbeinsvik, and Kaldbaksvik as far as Kaldbak's Cliff.  
Afterwards Eirik gave him Veidileysa with Reykjarfjord and the
outer part of Reykjanes on that side.  Nothing was settled about
the drift which came to the coast, because there was so much of
it that every one could have what he wanted.  Onund made his home
in Kaldbak and had a large household.  His property increased
and he had another house in Reykjarfjord.  Kolbeinn lived in
Kolbeinsvik and for some years Onund lived quietly at home.


CHAPTER X

OFEIG GRETTIR IS KILLED.  VISIT OF ONUND TO AUD THE DEEP-MINDED

Onund was a man of such valour that few, even of those whose
limbs were sound, could measure themselves against him.  His
name, too, was renowned throughout the whole country on account
of his ancestry.  It happened that a dispute arose between Ofeig
Grettir and one Thorbjornm called Jarlakappi, which ended in
Ofeig being killed by Thorbjorn in Grettisgeil near Haell.  The
feud was taken up by Ofeig's sons who assembled a large force of
men.  Onund Treefoot was sent for, and in the spring he rode
South to Hvamm, where he stayed with Aud the Deep-Minded.  He had
been with her over the sea in the West, and she received him with
welcome.  Her grandson, Olaf Feilan, was then grown up, and Aud
was very infirm.  She consulted Onund concerning her kinsman
Olaf, for whom she wished to ask in marriage Alfdis of the Barra
Isles, the cousin of Onund's wife Aesa.  Onund thought it a very
suitable match, and Olaf rode with him to the South.  Then Onund
met friends and kinsmen, who made him their guest.  The matter of
the dispute was talked over between them, and finally laid before
the Kjalarnes Thing, for the All-Thing had not yet been
established.  Eventually it was settled by arbitration and heavy
weregilds were imposed for the murder.  Thorbjorn Jarlakappi was
exiled.  His son was Solmund, the father of Svidukari.  These
kinsmen were long abroad after that.  Thrand invited Onund and
Olaf with his party to stay with him, as did Thormod Shaft.  The
matter of Olaf's marriage was then pressed, and an agreement
easily arrived at, for Aud's rank and influence were well known
to them.  The settlement was arranged and Onund's party rode home
again.  Aud thanked him for his aid in behalf of Olaf, who
married Alfdis of the Barra Isles that autumn.  Then Aud the
Deep-Minded died, as is told in the Laxdaela Saga.


CHAPTER XI

DEATH OF ONUND.  DISPUTES BETWEEN THE SONS OF ONUND AND OF EIRIK

Onund and Aesa had two sons; the elder was named Thorgeir, the
younger Ofeig Grettir.  Soon afterwards Aesa died and Onund
married a second wife, Thordis Thorgrim's daughter of Gnup in
Midfjord, a kinsman of Skeggi of Midfjord.  By her Onund
had a son named Thorgrim, who grew up quickly to manhood, ta11
and strong, wise and a good manager.  Onund continued to live at
Kaldbak until his old age.  He died a natural death and lies in
Treefoot's howe.  He was the boldest and most active one-legged
man that ever came to Iceland.

Among Onund's sons Thorgrim was the foremost, although the others
were older.  When he was twenty-five years old his hair was grey,
whence they nick-named him Greyhead.  His mother Thordis married
again, taking as her second husband Audun Skokull.  They had a
son named Asgeir of Asgeirsa.  Thorgrim Greyhead and his brothers
had a large property, which they managed together without
dividing it up.

Eirik lived, as was mentioned, at Arnes.  He had married Alof,
the daughter of Ingolf of Ingolfsfjord, by whom he had a son
named Flosi, a very promising young man with many friends.

There came to that part of Iceland three brothers, named Ingolf,
Ofeig, and Eyvind, and took the three fjords which are called by
their names, where they lived.  Eyvind had a son named Olaf.  He
at first lived at Eyvindsfjord, but went later to Drangar.  He
was a most capable man.

So long as their fathers were living no disputes arose among
these men; but when Eirik was dead it occurred to Flosi that
those of Kaldbak had no legal title to the lands which Eirik had
given to Onund.  Out of this serious dissensions arose between
them.  Thorgrim and his brothers continued in possession of the
lands as before, but they would not join in games together. 
Thorgeir, the eldest brother, was managing the farm at
Reykjarfjord, and often rowed out fishing, as the fjords were
full of fish.  The men of Vik now laid their plans.  Flosi had a
man in Arnes named Thorfinn, and sent him to fetch Thorgeir's
head.  This man hid himself in the boatshed.  One morning when
Thorgeir was preparing to row out with two other men, one of whom
was named Brand, Thorgeir was walking ahead with a leather skin
on his back containing some drink.  It was very dark, and as he
passed the boat-house Thorfinn sprang out upon him and dealt him
a blow with an axe between his shoulders.  The axe went into
something and made a squeaking noise.  Thorfinn let go his axe,
feeling quite sure that no bandages would be needed, and being
very anxious to escape as fast as he could.  He ran North, and
reaching Arnes before the day had quite broken, said that he had
killed Thorgeir and that Flosi must protect him.  The only thing
to be done was to offer some compensation in money.  "That," he
said, "will be the best thing for us after such a terrible piece
of work."

Flosi said he must first learn more about it, and that he thought
Thorfinn seemed very frightened after his doughty deed.

We must now tell what had happened to Thorgeir.  He turned round
when he was struck, but the blow had gone into the leather
bottle, and he was unhurt.  They could make no search for the man
because it was dark, so they rowed on down the fjord to Kaldbak,
where they told what had happened.  People made great game of the
affair and called him Thorgeir Bottleback, a name which stuck to
him ever after.  A verse was made:

     "In days gone by men bathed their blades
     in the streaming gore of a foeman's wound.
     But now a wretch of all honour bereft
     reddens his dastard axe in whey."


CHAPTER XII

BATTLE AT RIFSKER

At that time there came over Iceland a famine the like of which
had never been seen before.  Nearly all the fisheries failed, and
also the drift wood.  So it continued for many years.

One autumn some traders in a sea-going ship, who had been driven
out of their course, were wrecked at Vik.  Flosi took in four or
five of them with their captain, named Steinn.  They all found
shelter in the neighbourhood of Vik and tried to rig up a ship
out of the wreckage, but were not very successful.  The ship was
too narrow in the bow and stern and too broad amidships.  In the
spring a northerly gale set in which lasted nearly a week, after
which men began to look for drift.

There was a man living in Reykjanes named Thorsteinn.  He found a
whale stranded on the south side of the promontory at the place
now called Rifsker.  It was a large rorqual, and he at once sent
word by a messenger to Flosi in Vik and to the nearest farms.

At Gjogr lived a man named Einar, a tenant of the Kaldbak men
whom they employed to look after the drift on that side of the
fjord.  He got to know of the whale having been stranded and at
once rowed across the fjord in his boat to Byrgisvik, whence he
sent a messenger to Kaldbak.  When Thorgrim and his brother heard
the news they got ready to go with all speed to the spot.  There
were twelve of them in a ten-oared boat, and six others, with
Ivar and Leif, sons of Kolbeinn.  All the farmers who could get
away went to the whale.

In the meantime Flosi had sent word to his kinsmen in the North
at Ingolfsfjord and Ofeigsfjord and to Olaf the son of Eyvind who
lived at Drangar.  The first to arrive were Flosi and the men of
Vik, who at once began to cut up the whale, carrying on shore the
flesh as it was cut.  At first there were about twenty men, but
more came thronging in.  Then there came the men of Kaldbak with
four ships.  Thorgrim laid claim to the whale and forbade the men
of Vik to cut, distribute, or carry away any portion of it. 
Flosi called upon him to show proof that Eirik had in express
words given over the drift to Onund; if not, he said he would
prevent them by force.  Thorgrim saw that he was outnumbered and
would not venture on fighting.  Then there came a ship across the
fjords, the men rowing with all their might.  They came up; it
was Svan of Hol from Bjarnarfjord with his men, and he at once
told Thorgrim not to let himself be robbed.  The two men had been
great friends, and Svan offered Thorgrim his aid, which the
brothers accepted, and they attacked valiantly.  Thorgeir
Bottleback was the first to get on to the whale where Flosi's men
were.  Thorfinn, who was spoken of before, was cutting it up,
standing near the head on the place where he had been carving. 
"Here I bring you your axe," said Thorgeir.  Then he struck at
Thorfinn's neck and cut off his head.  Flosi was up on the beach
and saw it.  He urged on his men to give it them back.  They
fought for a long time and the Kaldbak people were getting the
best of it.  Most of them had no weapons but the axes with which
they were cutting up the whale and short knives.  The men of Vik
were driven from the whale on to the sandbanks.  The men from the
East, however, were armed and able to deal wounds.  Their captain
Steinn cut off the leg of Kolbeinn's son Ivar, and Ivar's brother
Leif beat one of Steinn's men to death with a rib of the whale. 
Then they fought with anything they could get, and men were slain
on both sides.  At last Olaf came up with a number of ships from
Drangar and joined Flosi; the men of Kaldbak were then
overpowered by numbers.  They had already loaded their ships, and
Svan told them to get on board.  They therefore retired towards
the ships, the men of Vik after them.  Svan on reaching the sea
struck at Steinn their captain, wounding him badly, and then
sprang into his own ship.  Thorgrim gave Flosi a severe wound and
escaped.  Olaf wounded Ofeig Grettir fatally, but Thorgeir
carried him off and sprang on to his ship with him.  The Kaldbak
men rowed into the fjord and the two parties separated.

The following verse was composed on these doings:

     "Hard were the blows which were dealt at Rifsker;
     no weapons they had but steaks of the whale.
     They belaboured each other with rotten blubber.
     Unseemly methinks is such warfare for men."

After this they made peace, and the dispute was laid before the
All-Thing.  On the side of the Kaldbak men were Thorodd the Godi,
Skeggi of Midfjord, and many others from the South.  Flosi was
exiled, along with several others who had been with him.  He was
put to great expense, for he insisted upon paying all the fines
himself.  Thorgrim and his brothers were unable to show that they
had paid any money either for the land or for the drift which
Flosi claimed.  The Lawman was Thorkell Mani, and the question
was referred to him.  He declared that by law something must have
been paid, though not necessarily the full value.

"There was a case in point," he said, "between my grandfather
Ingolf and a woman named Steinvor the Old.  He gave her the whole
of Rosmhvalanes and she gave him a dirty cloak for it; the
transfer was afterwards held to be valid.  That was a much more
important affair than this.  My advice is that the land be
divided in equal portions between the two; and henceforward it
shall be legally established that all drift shall be the property
of the owner of the land upon which it has been stranded."

This was agreed to.  Thorgrim and his brothers were to give up
Reykjarfjord with all on that side, and were to keep Kamb.  For
Ofeig a large sum of money was paid, and Thorfinn was assessed at
nothing at all; Thorgeir received compensation for the attack
made upon his life, and all the parties were reconciled.  Flosi
went to Norway with Steinn the captain and sold his lands in Vik
to Geirmund Hvikatimbr, who lived there thenceforward.

The ship which Steinn's sailors had built was rather a tub.  She
was called Trekyllir -- Tree-sack.  Flosi went on his journey in
her, but was driven back to Oxarfjord; out of this arose the saga
of Bodmod the Champion and Grimolf.


CHAPTER XIII

THORGRIM SETTLES AT BJARG AND MARRIES.  HIS SON ASMUND VISITS
NORWAY AND MARRIES TWICE

After these events Thorgrim and his brothers divided up the
property between them.  Thorgrim took the movable property and
Thorgeir the lands.  Then Thorgrim went inland to Midfjord and
bought some land at Bjarg with the aid of Skeggi.  He married
Thordis, the daughter of Asmund from Asmund's peak who had land
in Thingeyrasveit.  They had a son named Asmund, a great man and
strong, also wise, and notable for his abundance of hair, which
turned grey very early.  He was called Longhair.

Thorgrim occupied himself with the management of his estate and
kept all the men of his household hard at work.  Asmund did not
want to work, so that he and his father got on rather badly
together.  This continued until Asmund was grown up, when he
asked his father to give him the means to go abroad.  Thorgrim
said he should have little enough, but he gave him some ready
cash.  So Asmund went away and soon increased his capital.  He
sailed to divers lands, became a great trader and very wealthy. 
He was popular and enjoyed good credit, and had many friends
among the leading men of Norway.

One autumn Asmund was in the East on a visit to a certain magnate
named Thorsteinn.  His family came from the Upplands, and he had
a sister named Rannveig who had excellent prospects.  Asmund
asked this girl in marriage and obtained her through the interest
of her brother Thorsteinn; he settled there for a time and was
highly thought of.  He and Rannveig had a son named Thorsteinn,
who became a handsome man, strong, and with a powerful voice.  He
was very tall and rather sluggish in his movements, wherefore he
was nicknamed Dromund.  When young Thorsteinn was half grown up
his mother fell ill and died, and Asmund cared no more for
Norway.  Thorsteinn was taken over by his mother's relations
along with his property, while Asmund went on voyages and became
famous.

Asmund came in his ship to Hunavain, where Thorkell Krafla was
chief of the Vatnsdalers.  On hearing of Asmund's arrival
Thorkell went to the ship and invited him to stay, and Asmund
went to visit him in Marsstadir in Vatnsdal where he lived. 
Thorkell was a son of Thorgrim, the Godi of Karnsa, and a man of
great experience.  This was soon after the arrival of Bishop
Fridrek and Thorvald the son of Kodran, who were living at
Laekjamot when these events happened, preaching Christianity for
the first time in the North of the island.  Thorkell and many of
his men received the prima signatio.  Many things might be told
of the dealings between the bishop's men and the Northerners,
which, however, do not belong to this saga.

There was a girl named Asdis who was being brought up in
Thorkell's house.  She was a daughter of Bard the son of Jokull,
the son of Ingimund the Old, the son of Thorsteinn, the son of
Ketil Raum.  Her mother's name was Aldis, whom we have already
heard of as the daughter of Ofeig Grettir.  Asdis was not
betrothed as yet, and was a most desirable match, both on account
of her connections and her wealth.  Asmund now became sick of
travelling about and wanted to settle down in Iceland.  So he
spoke up and asked for Asdis as his wife.  Thorkell knew all
about him and knew that he was a man of wealth, able to manage
his affairs, so the marriage was arranged.  Asmund married Asdis,
and became a close friend of Thorkell.  He was a great man of
affairs, learned in the law and very strenuous.  Soon afterwards
Thorgrim Greyhead died at Bjarg; Asmund succeeded to his property
and took up his residence at Bjarg.


CHAPTER XIV

ASMUND'S CHILDREN.  GRETTIR'S CHILDH00D

Asmund Longhair now set up a large and sumptuous household in
Bjarg, where he maintained a numerous retinue and became very
popular.  His children were as follows: The eldest was Atli, an
able and accomplished man, tactful and easy to deal with; he was
much liked by all.  His second son was called Grettir.  He was
very hard to manage in his bringing up.  He spoke little and was
rough in his manners and quarrelsome, both in words and deeds. 
He got little affection from his father Asmund, but his mother
loved him dearly.  Grettir was a handsome man in appearance, with
a face rather broad and short, red-haired and somewhat freckled;
not very precocious in his youth.  There was a daughter named
Thordis, who afterwards married Glum the son of Ospak, Kjallak's
son from Skridinsenni.  Another daughter was named Rannveig; she
married Gamli the son of Thorhall of Vineland, and they dwelt at
Melar in Hrutafjord and had a son named Grim.  Glum and Thordis
had a son named Ospak who fell into a dispute with Odd the son of
Ofeig, which is told of in the "Saga of the Banded Men."

Grettir grew up at Bjarg until he was ten years old, when he
began to develop a little.  Asmund told him that he must do some
work.  Grettir said that would not suit him very well, but asked
what he was to do.

"You must mind the geese," said Asmund.

"That is wretched work, only fit for an idiot," Grettir answered.

"You do that properly," his father said, "and we shall get on
better together."

So Grettir went to mind the geese.  There were fifty of them, and
a number of goslings.  Before long he began to find them
troublesome, and the goslings would not come on quickly enough. 
This put him out, for he could never control his temper.  Soon
afterwards some wanderers found the goslings lying outside dead,
and the geese with their wings broken.  This was in the autumn. 
Asmund was very much annoyed and asked Grettir whether he had
killed the birds.  Grettir grinned and answered:

     "Always when winter is coming on
     I like to wring the goslings' necks.
     If among them there are geese
     I treat the creatures all alike."

"You shan't twist any more of their necks," said Asmund.

"The friend aye warns his friend of ill," answered Grettir.

"I will give you other work to do."

"He knoweth most who most hath tried.  But what am I to do now?"
Grettir asked.

"You shall rub my back when I am sitting by the fire, as I am in
the habit of having it done."

"Warm work for the hands." he answered.  "It is only fit for an
idiot."

This for a time was Grettir's occupation.  As the autumn advanced
Asmund wanted more warmth, and was constantly telling Grettir to
rub his back hard.  It was the custom in those days for people to
have large rooms with long fires in them in their houses, where
men sat by the fire in the evenings on benches, sleeping
afterwards at the side away from the fries.  By day the women
carded their wool there.

One evening when Grettir had to scratch Asmund's back his father
said to him: "Now you will have to put aside your laziness, you
good-for-nothing you."

Grettir answered: "`Tis ill to rouse a hasty temper."

"You are fit for nothing at all," said Asmund.

Grettir saw some wood-combs lying on one of the benches; he took
up one of them and drew it along Asmund's back.  Asmund sprang up
and was going to thrash him with his stick, but he escaped.  His
mother came up and asked what they were fighting about.  Grettir
answered in a verse:

     "Oh lady, the giver of treasure, I see,
     has dire intent to burn my hands.
     With nails uncut I was stroking his back.
     Clearly I see the bird of wounds."

His mother was much vexed with Grettir for what he had done and
said he would not grow up very prudent.  The affair did not
improve the relations between Asmund and his son.

Soon after this Asmund spoke to Grettir and told him to look
after his horses.  Grettir said that would be better than
back-fire-warming.

"You are to do what I tell you," said Asmund.  "I have a dun mare
with a dark stripe down her back whom I call Keingala.  She is
very knowing about the weather and about rain coming.  When she
refuses to graze it never fails that a storm will follow.  You
are then to keep the horses under shelter in the stables, and
when cold weather sets in keep them to the north of the ridge.  I
hope you will perform this duty better than the two which I gave
you before."

Grettir said: "That is cold work, and fit for a man to do; but it
seems to me rash to trust to the mare, when to my knowledge no
one has done so before."

So Grettir took to minding the horses, and went on until Yule-
tide was past, when very cold weather set in, with snow, so that
grazing was difficult.  He was very badly provided with clothes
and little hardened to the weather.  He began to feel it very
cold, and Keingala always chose the windiest places whatever the
weather was.  She never came to the meadow early enough to get
home before nightfall.  Grettir then thought he would play a
trick upon Keingala to pay her out for her wanderings.  One
morning early he came to the stables, opened the door and found
Keingala standing in front of the manger.  She had taken the
whole of the fodder which had been given to all the horses for
herself.  Grettir jumped upon her back, with a sharp knife in his
hand which he drew across her shoulder and along her back on both
sides.  The horse was fat and fresh; she shied back very
frightened and kicked out till her hoofs rattled against the
walls.  Grettir fell off, but picked himself up and tried to
mount her again.  There was a sharp struggle, which ended in his
shaving all the skin on her back down to her flank.  Then he
drove the horses out to the meadow.  Keingala would not take a
bite except off her back, and soon after noon she bolted off to
the stables.  Grettir locked the door and went home.  Asmund
asked him where the horses were; he said he had looked after them
as usual.  Asmund said there must be a storm close at hand if the
horses would not stay out in such weather as there was then.

Grettir said: "Many seem wise who are lacking in wit."

The night passed and there was no storm.  Grettir drove out the
horses, but Keingala could not endure the pasture.  Asmund
thought it very strange that no change came in the weather.  On
the third morning he went himself to the horses and on seeing
Keingala he said: "III indeed have the horses fared in this
beautiful weather!  Thy back will not deceive me, my Bleikala."

"The likely may happen -- also the unlikely," said Grettir.

Asmund stroked the back of the horse and all her coat came off on
his hand.  He could not understand how she had got into that
state and thought Grettir must have done it.  Grettir grinned and
said nothing.  Asmund went home and became very abusive.  He
heard his wife say: "My son's watching of the horses must have
prospered well."

Then he spoke a verse:

     "He has cheated me sorely, and Keingala shorn.
     'Tis the pride of a woman that urges her tongue.
     Artful he holds my commands in derision.
     Consider my verses, oh wife of my heart."

"I do not know," she said, "which seems to me the more perverse,
for you to make him work, or for him always to get out of it in
the same way."

"Now there shall be an end to it," said Asmund.  "He must have
something worse than merely making good the damage."

"Let neither speak of it to the other," said Grettir, and so it
remained.

Asmund had Keingala killed.  Many more childish pranks did
Grettir play which are not told in the saga.  He now began to
grow very big, but men did not clearly know what strength he had
because he had never been tried in wrestling.  He kept making
verses and ditties which were always a little ironical.  He did
not sleep in the common room and was generally very silent.


CHAPTER XV

GAMES AT MIDFJORDVATN

There were then a good many youths growing up in Midfjord.  A
certain Skaldtorfa, whose home was in Torfustadir, had a son
named Bersi, an accomplished young man and a clever poet.  Two
brothers named Kormak and Thorgils lived at Mel and had with them
a youth named Odd, who was dependent upon them, and was nicknamed
Odd the Needy-Skald.  Another was named Audun; he grew up in
Audunarstad in Vididal, a pleasant good-natured youth and the
strongest of his age in the North.  Kalf the son of Asgeir and
his brother Thorvald lived at Asgeirsa.  Grettir's brother Atli
was then growing to a man; he was most gracious in manners and
universally liked.

These youths used to play at ball together at Midfjord Water. 
Those from Midfjord and from Vididal used to meet there, and
there came many from Vestrhop and Vatnsnes with some from
Hrutafjord.  Those who came from afar used to lodge there.  Those
who were about equal in the ball-game were matched together, and
generally they had much fun in the autumn.  Grettir went to the
sports when he was fourteen years old at the request of his
brother Atli.  The parties were made up.  Grettir was matched
against Audun, the youth already mentioned, who was a few years
the elder.  Audun struck the ball over Grettir's head so that he
could not reach it, and it bounded far away over the ice. 
Grettir lost his temper, thinking he had done it out of mischief,
but he fetched the ball, brought it back and going up to Audun
drove it straight into his forehead, so that the skin was broken.

Audun then struck at Grettir with the bat that he was holding,
but Grettir ducked and the blow missed him.  Then they seized
each other with their arms and wrestled.  It was evident to the
people around that Grettir was stronger than they had supposed,
for Audun was very strong indeed of body.  They struggled long
together until at last Grettir was thrown.  Audun then set his
knees on his stomach and dealt unmercifully with him.  Atli and
Bersi and a number of the others ran up and separated them. 
Gretti said they need not hold him like a mad dog, and added:
"The thrall alone takes instant vengeance, the coward never."

The rest had no mind to let the affair create discord among them,
and the brothers Kalf and Thorvald tried to reconcile them. 
Audun and Grettir were distantly related to each other.  The
games went on and there was no further disturbance.


CHAPTER XVI

GRETTIR KILLS SKEGGI AND IS OUTLAWED FOR THREE YEARS

Thorkell Krafla now began to grow very old.  He was a great
chieftain and held the Vatnsdal Godord.  He was a close friend of
Asmund Longhair, as befitted the near relations in which they
stood to each other.  He had, therefore, been in the habit of
riding every year in the spring to Bjarg to visit his kinsmen
there, and he did so in the spring which followed the events just
related.  Asmund and Asdis received him with both hands.  He
stayed there three nights and many a matter did the kinsmen
discuss together.  Thorkell asked Asmund what his heart told him
about his sons, and what professions they were likely to follow. 
Asmund said that Atli would probably be a great landowner, very
careful and wealthy.

"A useful man, like yourself," said Thorkell.  "But what can you
tell me of Grettir? "

"I can only say," he replied, "that he will be a strong man; but
headstrong and quarrelsome.  A heavy trial has he been to me."

"That does not look very promising, kinsman!"  said Thorkell. 
"But how are we to arrange our journey to the Thing in the
summer? "

"I am getting difficult to move," he said.  "I would rather stay
at home."

"Would you like Atli to go for you?"

"I don't think I can spare him," Asmund said, "because of the
work and the provisioning.  Grettir will not do anything.  But he
has quite wit enough to carry out the duties at the Thing on my
behalf under your guidance."

"It shall be as you please," said Thorkell.

Then Thorkell made himself ready and rode home; Asmund dismissed
him with presents.

A little later Thorkell journeyed to the Thing with sixty men. 
All the men of his godord went with him.  They passed through
Bjarg, where Grettir joined them.  They rode South through the
heath called Tvidaegra.  There was very little grazing to be had
in the hills, so they rode quickly past them into the cultivated
land.  When they reached Fljotstunga they thought it was time to
sleep, so they took the bits from their horses and turned them
loose with their saddles.  They lay there well on into the day,
and when they woke began to look for their horses.  Every horse
had gone off in a different direction and some had been rolling. 
Grettir could not find his horse at all.  The custom was at that
time that men should find their own provisions at the Thing, and
most of them carried their sacks over their saddles.  When
Grettir found his horse its saddle was under its belly, and the
sack of provisions gone.  He searched about but could not find
it.  Then he saw a man running very fast and asked him who he
was.  He said his name was Skeggi and that he was a man from Ass
in Vatnsdal in the North.

"I am travelling with Thorkell," he said.  "I have been careless
and lost my provision-bag."

"Alone in misfortune is worst.  I also have lost my stock of
provisions; so we can look for them together.  "

Skeggi was well pleased with this proposal, and so they went
about seeking for a time.  Suddenly, when Grettir least expected
it, Skeggi started running with all his might along the moor and
picked up the sack.  Grettir saw him bend and asked what it was
that he had picked up.

"My sack," he said.

"Who says so besides yourself?" Grettir asked.  "Let me see it!
Many a thing is like another."

Skeggi said no one should take from him what was his own. 
Grettir seized hold of the sack and they both pulled at it for a
time, each trying to get his own way.

"You Midfjord men have strange notions," said Skeggi, "if you
think that because a man is not so wealthy as you are, he is not
to dare to hold to his own before you."

Grettir said it had nothing to do with a man's degree, and that
each should have that which was his own.

Skeggi replied: "Audun is now too far away to strangle you as he
did at the ball-play."

"That is well," said Grettir; "but however that may have been you
shall not strangle me."

Skeggi then seized his axe and struck at Grettir, who on seeing
it seized the handle of the axe with his left hand and pulled it
forward with such force that Skeggi at once let go.  The next
moment it stood in his brain and he fell dead to the earth. 
Grettir took the sack, threw it across his saddle and rode back
to his companions.

Thorkell rode on, knowing nothing of what had happened.  Soon
Skeggi was missed in the company, and when Grettir came up they
asked him what news he had of Skeggi.  He answered in a verse:

     "Hammer-troll ogress has done him to death.
     Thirsting for blood the war-fiend came.
     With hard-edged blade she gaped, o'er his head,
     nor spared she his teeth.  I saw it myself."

Then Thorkell's men sprang up and said it was impossible that a
troll should have taken the man in full daylight.  Thorkell was
silent for a moment.  Then he said: "There must be something
more in it.  Grettir must have killed him.  What was it that
really happened, Grettir?"

Grettir then told him all about their fight.  Thorkell said: "It
is a most unfortunate occurrence, because Skeggi was entrusted to
my service, and was a man of good family.  I will take the matter
upon myself and pay whatever compensation is adjudged.  But a
question of banishment does not lie with me.  Now, Grettir, there
are two things for you to choose between.  Either you can go on
to the Thing with us and take the chance of what may happen
there, or you can turn back and go home."

Grettir decided to go on to the Thing, and to the Thing he went. 
The matter was taken up by the heirs of the man slain.  Thorkell
gave his hand to pay the compensation and Grettir was to be
banished for three years.

On their way back from the Thing all the chiefs halted at
Sledaass before they parted company.  It was then that Grettir
lifted a stone lying in the grass, which is still known as
Grettishaf.  Many went afterwards to see this stone and were
astounded that so young a man should have lifted such a mountain.

Grettir rode home to Bjarg and told his father about his
adventures.  Asmund was much put out and said he would be a
trouble to everybody.


CHAPTER XVII

GRETTIR SAILS FOR NORWAY AND IS WRECKED ON HARAMARSEY

There dwelt at Reydarfell on the banks of the Hvita a man named
Haflidi, a mariner, owning a ship of his own which was lying in
dock in the Hvita river.  He had as his mate a man named Bard who
had a young and pretty wife.  Asmund sent a man to Haflidi asking
him to take Grettir and look after him.  Haflidi answered that he
had heard that Grettir was very difficult to get on with, but out
of friendship for Asmund he took him.  Grettir, therefore,
prepared to go to sea.  His father would not give him any outfit
for his voyage beyond his bare provisions and a little wadmal. 
Grettir asked him to give him some sort of weapon.  Asmund
answered: "You have never been obedient to me.  Nor do I know
what you would do with a weapon that would be of any profit.  I
shall not give you any."

Grettir said: "Work not done needs no reward."

Father and son parted with little love between them.  Many wished
him a good voyage, but few a safe return.  His mother went with
him along the road.  Before they parted she said: "You have not
been sent off in the way that I should have wished, my son, or in
a way befitting your birth.  The most cruel thing of all, I
think, is that you have not a weapon which you can use.  My heart
tells me that you will want one."

Then she took from under her mantle a sword all ready for use, a
valuable possession.  She said: "This was the sword of jokull, my
father's father and of the ancient Vatnsdal men, in whose hands
it was blessed with victory.  I give it to you; use it well."

Grettir thanked her warmly and said it would be more precious to
him than any other possession though of greater value.  Then he
went on his way and Asdis wished him all possible happiness.  He
rode South over the heath and did not stop till he reached his
ship.  Haflidi received him well and asked him about his outfit
for the voyage.  Grettir spoke a verse:

     "Oh trimmer of sails I my father is wealthy,
     but poorly enough he sent me from home.
     My mother it was who gave me this sword.
     True is the saying: The mother is best."

Haflidi said it was evident that she had most thought for him.

Directly they were ready and had a wind they got under way. 
When they were out of shallow water they hoisted their sail. 
Grettir made himself a corner under the ship's boat, whence he
refused to stir either to bale or to trim the sails or to do any
work in the ship, as it was his duty to do equally with the other
men; nor would he buy himself off.  They sailed to the South,
rounded Reykjanes and left the land behind them, when they met
with stormy weather.  The ship was rather leaky and became very
uneasy in the gale; the crew were very much exhausted.  Grettir
only let fly satirical verses at them, which angered them sorely.

One day when it was very stormy and very cold the men called out
to Grettir to get up and work; they said their claws were quite
frozen.  He answered:

     "Twere well if every finger were froze
     on the hands of such a lubberly crew."

They got no work out of him and liked him even worse than before,
and said they would pay him out on his person for his squibs and
his mutinous behaviour.

"You like better," they said, "to pat the belly of Bard the
mate's wife than to bear a hand in the ship.  But we don't mean
to stand it."

The weather grew steadily worse; they had to bale night and
day, and they threatened Grettir.  Haflidi when he heard them
went up to Grettir and said: "I don't think your relations with
the crew are very good.  You are mutinous and make lampoons about
them, and they threaten to pitch you overboard.  This is most
improper."

"Why cannot they mind their own business?"  Grettir rejoined. 
"But I should like one or two to remain behind with me before I
go overboard."

"That is impossible," said Haflidi.  "We shall never get on upon
those terms.  But I will make you a proposal about it."

"What is that?"

"The thing which annoys them is that you make lampoons about
them.  Now I suggest that you make a lampoon about me.  Then,
perhaps, they will become better disposed towards you."

"About you I will never utter anything but good," said he.  "I am
not going to compare you with the sailors."

"But you might compose a verse which should at first appear foul,
but on closer view prove to be fair."

"That," he answered, "I am quite equal to."

Haflidi then went to the sailors and said: "You have much toil;
and it seems that you don't get on with Grettir."

"His lampoons," they answered, "annoy us more than anything
else."

Then Haflidi, speaking loud, said: "It will be the worse for him
some day."

Grettir, when he heard himself being denounced, spoke a verse:

     "Other the words that Haflid spake
     when he dined on curds at Reydarfell.
     But now two meals a day he takes
     in the steed of the bays mid foreland shores."

The sailors were very angry and said he should not lampoon
Haflidi for nothing.  Haflidi said: "Grettir certainly deserves
that you should take him down a little, but I am not going to
risk my good name because of his ill-temper and caprice.  This is
not the time to pay him out, when we are all in such danger. 
When you get on shore you can remember it if you like."

"Shall we not endure what you can endure?" they said.  "Why
should a lampoon hurt us more than it does you? "

Haflidi said so it should be, and after that they cared less
about Grettir's lampoons.

The voyage was long and fatiguing.  The ship sprung a leak, and
the men began to be worn out.  The mate's young wife was in the
habit of stitching Grettir's sleeves for him, and the men used to
banter him about it.  Haflidi went up to Grettir where he was
lying and said:

     "Arise from thy den! deep furrows we plough!
     Remember the word thou didst speak to the fair.
     Thy garment she sewed; but now she commands
     that thou join in the toil while the land is afar."

Grettir got up at once and said:

     "I will rise, though the ship be heavily rolling.
     The woman is vexed that I sleep in my den.
     She will surely be wrath if here I abide
     while others are toiling at work that is mine."

Then he hurried aft where they were baling and asked what they
wanted him to do.  They said he would do little good.  He
replied: "A man's help is something."  Haflidi told them not to
refuse his help.  "Maybe," he said, "he is thinking of loosening
his hands if he offers his services."

In those days in sea-going ships there were no scuppers for
baling; they only had what is called bucket or pot-baling, a very
troublesome and fatiguing process.  There were two buckets, one
of which went down while the other came up.  The men told Grettir
to take the buckets down, and said they would try what he could
do.  He said the less tried the better, and went below and filled
his bucket.  There were two men above to empty the buckets as he
handed them.  Before long they both gave in from fatigue.  Then
four others took their places, but the same thing happened.  Some
say that before they were done eight men were engaged in emptying
the buckets for him.  At last the ship was baled dry.  After
this, the seamen altered their behaviour towards Grettir, for
they realised the strength which was in him.  From that time on
he was ever the forwardest to help wherever he was required.

They now held an easterly course out to sea.  It was very dark. 
One night when they least expected it, they struck a rock and the
lower part of the ship began to fill.  The boats were got out and
the women put into them with all the loose property.  There was
an island a little way off, whither they carried as much of their
property as they could get off in the night.  When the day broke,
they began to ask where they were.  Some of them who had been
about the country before recognised the coast of Sunnmore in
Norway.  There was an island lying a little off the mainland
called Haramarsey, with a large settlement and a farm belonging
to the Landman on it.


CHAPTER XVIII

ADVENTURE IN THE HOWE OF KAR THE OLD

The name of the Landman who lived in the island was Thorfinn.  He
was a son of Kar the Old, who had lived there for a long time. 
Thorfinn was a man of great influence.

When the day broke, the people on the island saw that there were
some sailors there in distress and reported it to Thorfinn, who
at once set about to launch his large sixteen-oared boat.  He put
out as quickly as possible with some thirty men to save the cargo
of the trader, which then sank and was lost, along with much
property.  Thorfinn brought all the men off her to his house,
where they stayed for a week drying their goods.  Then they went
away to the South, and are heard of no more in this story. 

Grettir stayed behind with Thorfinn, keeping very quiet and
speaking little.  Thorfinn gave him his board, but took little
notice of him.  Grettir held rather aloof, and did not accompany
him when he went abroad every day.  This annoyed Thorfinn, but he
did not like to refuse Grettir his hospitality; he was a man who
kept open house, enjoyed life and liked to see other men happy. 
Grettir liked going about and visiting the people in the other
farms on the island.  There was a man named Audun, who dwelt at
Vindheim.  Grettir went to see him daily and became very intimate
with him, sitting there all day long.

One evening very late when Grettir was preparing to return home,
he saw a great fire shoot up on the headland below Audun's place,
and asked what new thing that might be.  Audun said there was no
pressing need for him to know.

"If they saw such a thing in our country," said Grettir, "they
would say the fire came from some treasure."

"He who rules that fire," answered the man, "is one whom it will
be better not to inquire about."

"But I want to know," Grettir said.

"On that headland," said Audun, "there is a howe, wherein lies
Kar the Old, the father of Thorfinn.  Once upon a time father and
son had a farm-property on the island; but ever since Kar died
his ghost has been walking and has scared away all the other
farmers, so that now the whole island belongs to Thorfinn, and no
man who is under Thorfinn's protection suffers any injury."

"You have done right to tell me," said Grettir.  Expect me here
to-morrow morning, and have tools ready for digging."

"I won't allow you to have anything to do with it," said Audun,
"because I know that it will bring Thorfinn's wrath down upon
you."

Grettir said he would risk that.

The night passed; Grettir appeared early the next morning, and
the bondi, who had got all the tools for digging ready, went with
Grettir to the howe.  Grettir broke open the grave, and worked
with all his might, never stopping until he came to wood, by
which time the day was already spent.  He tore away the woodwork;
Audun implored him not to go down, but Grettir bade him attend to
the rope, saying that he meant to find out what it was that dwelt
there.  Then he descended into the howe.  It was very dark and
the odour was not pleasant.  He began to explore how it was
arranged, and found the bones of a horse.  Then he knocked
against a sort of throne in which he was aware of a man seated. 
There was much treasure of gold and silver collected together,
and a casket under his feet, full of silver.  Grettir took all
the treasure and went back towards the rope, but on his way he
felt himself seized by a strong hand.  He left the treasure to
close with his aggressor and the two engaged in a merciless
struggle.  Everything about them was smashed.  The howedweller
made a ferocious onslaught.  Grettir for some time gave way, but
found that no holding back was possible.  They did not spare each
other.  Soon they came to the place where the horse's bones were
lying, and here they struggled for long, each in turn being
brought to his knees.  At last it ended in the howedweller
falling backwards with a horrible crash, whereupon Audun above
bolted from the rope, thinking that Grettir was killed.  Grettir
then drew his sword Jokulsnaut, cut off the head of the
howedweller and laid it between his thighs.  Then he went with
the treasure to the rope, but finding Audun gone he had to swarm
up the rope with his hands.  First he tied the treasure to the
lower end of the rope, so that he could haul it up after him.  He
was very stiff from his struggle with Kar, but he turned his
steps towards Thorfinn's house, carrying the treasure along with
him.  He found them all at supper.  Thorfinn cast a severe glance
at him and asked what he had found so pressing to do that he
could not keep proper hours like other men.

"Many a trifle happens at eve," he replied.

Then he brought out all the treasure which he had taken from the
howe and laid it on the table.  One thing there was upon which
more than anything else Grettir cast his eyes, a short sword,
which he declared to be finer than any weapon which he had ever
seen.  It was the last thing that he showed.  Thorfinn opened his
eyes when he saw the sword, for it was an heirloom of his family
and had never been out of it. 

"Whence came this treasure?" he asked.

Grettir then spake a verse:

     "Scatterer of gold!  'twas the lust of wealth
     that urged my hand to ravish the grave.
     This know; but none hereafter, I ween,
     will be fain to ransack Fafnir's lair."

Thorfinn said: "You don't seem to take it very seriously; no one
ever before had any wish to break open the howe.  But since I
know that all treasure which is hidden in the earth or buried in
a howe is in a wrong place I hold you guilty of no misdeed,
especially since you have brought it to me."

Grettir answered:

     "The monster is slain! in the dismal tomb
     I have captured a sword, dire wounder of men.
     Would it were mine I a treasure so rare
     I never would suffer my hand to resign."

"You have spoken well," Thorfinn answered.  "But before I can
give you the sword you must display your prowess in some way.  I
never got it from my father whilst he lived."

Grettir said: "No one knows to whom the greatest profit will
fall ere all is done."

Thorfinn took the treasure and kept the sword in his own custody
near his bed.  The winter came on bringing Yule-tide, and nothing
more happened that need be told of.


CHAPTER XIX

BERSERKS AT HARAMARSEY

The following summer jarl Eirik the son of Hakon was preparing to
leave his country and sail to the West to join his brother-in-law
King Knut the Great in England, leaving the government of Norway
in the hands of Hakon his son, who, being an infant, was placed
under the government and regency of Eirik's brother, jarl Sveinn.

Before leaving Eirik summoned all his Landmen and the larger
bondis to meet him.  Eirik the jarl was an able ruler, and they
had much discussion regarding the laws and their administration. 
It was considered a scandal in the land that pirates and berserks
should be able to come into the country and challenge respectable
people to the holmgang for their money or their women, no
weregild being paid whichever fell.  Many had lost their money
and been put to shame in this way; some indeed had lost their
lives.  For this reason jarl Eirik abolished all holmgang in
Norway and declared all robbers and berserks who disturbed the
peace outlaws.  Thorfinn the son of Kar of Haramarsey, being a
man of wise counsel and a close friend of the jarl, was present
at the meeting.

The worst of these ruffians were two brothers named Thorir Paunch
and Ogmund the Bad.  They came from Halogaland and were bigger
and stronger than other men.  When angry they used to fall into
the berserk's fury, and nothing escaped that was before them. 
They used to carry off men's wives, keep them for a week or two
and then send them back.  Wherever they came they committed
robberies and other acts of violence.  Jarl Eirik had declared
them outlaws throughout Norway.  The man who had been most active
in getting them outlawed was Thorfinn, and they were determined
to pay him out in full for his hostility.

The jarl's expedition is told of in his saga, and the government
of Norway was left in the hands of jarl Sveinn, with the regency.

Thorfinn returned home and remained there until about Yule-tide,
as has already been told.  Towards Yule-tide he made ready to go
on a journey to his farm called Slysfjord on the mainland,
whither he had invited a number of his friends.  He could not
take his wife with him, because their grown-up daughter was lying
sick, so they both had to stay at home.  Grettir and eight of the
serving men remained with them.  Thorfinn went with thirty
freemen to the Yule festival, at which there was much gladness
and merriment.

Yule-eve set in with bright and clear weather.  Grettir, who was
generally abroad in the daytime, was watching the vessels which
came along the coast, some from the North, some from the South,
meeting at the places agreed upon for their drinking-bouts.  The
bondi's daughter was then better and could go out with her
mother.  So the day passed.  At last Grettir noticed a ship
rowing up to the island, not large, covered with shields
amidships and painted above the water-line.  They were rowing
briskly and making for Thorfinn's boathouses.  They ran the boat
on to the beach and all sprang ashore.  Grettir counted the men;
there were twelve in all, and their aspect did not look peaceful.

After hauling up their boat out of the water they all made for
the boat-house where Thorfinn's great boat, mentioned already,
was stowed.  She always required thirty men to put her to sea,
but the twelve shoved her along the beach at once.  Then they
brought their own boat into the boat-house.  It was very evident
to Grettir that they did not mean to wait for an invitation, so
he went up to them, and greeting them in a friendly way asked who
they were and who was their captain.  The man whom he addressed
answered him at once, saying his name was Thorir, called Paunch;
the others were his brother Ogmund with their companions.  "I
think," he added, "that your master Thorfinn has heard our names
mentioned.  But is he at home? "

"You must be men who have luck," said Grettir, "you have come
most opportunely, if you are the people I take you for.  The
bondi has gone from home with all his freedmen and will not be
back until after Yule.  The goodwife is at home with her
daughter, and if I had any grudge to repay, I would come just as
you do, for there is everything here which you want, ale to drink
and other delights."

Thorir was silent while Grettir went on talking.  Then he turned
to Ogmund and said: "Has anything not happened as I said it
would?  I should not be sorry to punish Thorfinn for having got
us outlawed.  This man seems ready to tell us everything; we
don't have to drag the words out of his mouth."

"Every one is master of his own words," said Grettir.  "If you
will come home with me I will give you what entertainment I can."

They thanked him and said they would accept his invitation.  When
they reached the house Grettir took Thorir by the hand and led
him into the hall.  He was very talkative.  The mistress was in
the hall decorating it and putting all in order.  On hearing what
Grettir said, she came to the door and asked who it was that
Grettir was welcoming so warmly.

Grettir answered: "It will be advisable, mistress, to be civil to
these men who have come.  They are the bondi Thorir Paunch and
his followers, and have come, all twelve of them, to spend
Yule-tide here.  It is fortunate for us, for we have had little
company till now."

She said: "I don't call them bondis, nor are they decent men, but
arrant robbers and malefactors.  I would gladly pay a large
portion of my property for them not to have come just at this
time.  It is an ill return that you make to Thorfinn for having
saved you from shipwreck and kept you this winter like a free
man, destitute as you were."

"You would do better," said Grettir, "if you first took off the
wet clothes from your guests instead of casting reproaches upon
me.  You will have plenty of time for that."

Then Thorir said: "Don't be angry, mistress! You shall lose
nothing by your husband being away, for you shall have a man in
his place and so shall your daughter and all the other women."

"That is spoken like a man," said Grettir.  "The women shall be
quite contented with what they get.

Then all the women fled and began to weep, being overcome by
terror.  Grettir said to the berserks: "Give me all the things
which you want to lay aside, your weapons and your wet clothes,
for the men will not obey us while they are frightened."

Thorir said he cared little for the women's whining.  "But," he
said, "we mean to treat you in a different way from the other men
of the house.  It seems to me that we may make a comrade of you."

"See to that yourselves," said Grettir.  "But I do not look upon
all men alike."

Then they laid aside most of their weapons.  Grettir said: "I
think now you had better sit down at the table and have some
drink.  You must be thirsty after your rowing."

They said they were quite ready for a drink, but did not know
where the cellar was.  Grettir asked whether they would let him
arrange for their entertainment, which they willingly agreed
to.  So Grettir went and fetched some ale which he gave them to
drink.  They were very tired and drank enormously.  He kept them
well plied with the strongest ale there was, and they sat there
for a long time whilst he told them funny stories.  There was a
tremendous din amongst them all, and the servants had no wish to
approach them.

Thorir said: "I never yet met with a stranger who treated me like
this man.  What reward shall we give you for all that you have
done, Grettir?"

Grettir replied: "I don't expect any reward for my services at
present.  But if when you depart we are still as good friends as
we seem to be now, I should very much like to join your company,
and though I may not be able to do as much work as any of you, I
will not be a hindrance in any doughty undertaking."

They were delighted, and wanted to swear fellowship with him at
once.  Grettir said that could not be, "for," he added, "there is
truth in the saying that Ale is another man, and such a thing
should not be done hastily, so let it remain at what I said; we
are both little in the habit of restraining ourselves."

They declared that they did not mean to go back.  The night was
now coming on and it was getting very dark.  Grettir noticed that
they were rather fuddled, and asked whether they did not think it
was time to go to bed.  Thorir said: "So it is; but I have to
fulfil my promise to the mistress." Grettir then went out and
called out loud: "Go to bed, women!  Such is the will of Thorir
the bondi."

The women execrated him and could be heard howling like wolves. 
The berserks then left the room.  Grettir said: "Let us go
outside; I will show you the room in which Thorfinn keeps his
clothes."

They were agreeable and all went out to an enormous outhouse,
which was very strongly built, and had a strong lock on the outer
door.  Adjoining it was a large and well-built privy, with only a
wooden partition between it and the room of the outhouse, which
was raised above the ground and had to be reached by steps.  The
berserks then began skylarking and pushing Grettir about.  He
fell down the in steps, as if in sport, and in a moment was out
of the house, had pulled the bolt, slammed the door to, and
locked it.  Thorir and his mates thought at first that the door
had swung to of itself, and paid little attention; they had a
light with them by which Grettir had been showing them all
Thorfinn's treasures, and they continued looking at them for some
time.

Grettir went off to the homestead, and on reaching the door cried
out very loud, asking where the mistress was.  She was silent,
being afraid to answer.  He said: "Here is rather good sport to
be had.  Are there any arms which are good for anything?"

"There are arms," she said; "but I don't know for what purpose
you want them."

"We will talk about that afterwards; but now let each do what he
can; it is the last chance."

"Now indeed were God in the dwelling," she said, "if anything
should happen to save us.  Over Thorfinn's bed there hangs the
great halberd which belonged to Kar the Old; there, too, is a
helmet and a corselet and a good short sword.  The weapons will
not fail if your heart holds firm."

Grettir took the helmet and spear, girt the sword about him and
went quickly out.  The mistress called to her men and bade them
follow their brave champion.  Four of them rushed to their arms,
but the other four durst not go near them.

Meantime the berserks thought that Grettir was a long time away
and began to suspect some treachery.  They rushed to the door and
found it locked.  They strained at the woodwork till every timber
groaned.  At last they tore down the wooden partition and so
gained the passage where the privy was, and thence the steps. 
Then the berserks' fury fell upon them and they howled like dogs.

At that moment Grettir returned, and taking his halberd in both
hands he thrust it right through Thorir's body just as he was
about to descend the steps.  The blade was very long and broad. 
Ogmund the Bad was just behind pushing him on, so that the spear
passed right up to the hook, came out at his back between the
shoulderblades and entered the breast of Ogmund.  They both fell
dead, pierced by the spear.  Then all the others dashed down as
they reached the steps.  Grettir tackled them each in turn, now
thrusting with the spear, now hewing with the sword, while they
defended themselves with logs lying on the ground or with
anything else which they could get.  It was a terrible trial of a
man's prowess to deal with men of their strength, even unarmed.

Grettir slew two of the Halogaland men there in the enclosure. 
Four of the serving-men then came up.  They had not been able to
agree upon which arms each should take, but they came out to the
attack directly the berserks were running away; when these turned
against them they fell back on the house.  Six of the ruffians
fell, all slain by Grettir's own hand; the other six then fled
towards the landing place and took refuge in the boat-house,
where they defended themselves with oars.  Grettir received a
severe blow from one of them and narrowly escaped a serious hurt.

The serving-men all went home and told great stories of their own
exploits.  The lady wanted to know what had become of Grettir,
but they could not tell her.  Grettir slew two men in the boat-
house, but the other four got away, two in one direction, two in
another.  He pursued those who were nearest to him.  The night
was very dark.  They ran to Vindheim, the place spoken of before,
and took refuge in a barn, where they fought for a long time
until at last Grettir killed them.  By this time he was terribly
stiff and exhausted.  The night was far spent; it was very cold
and there were driving snow-storms.  He felt little inclination
to go after the two who yet remained, so he went back home.  The
goodwife kindled a light and put it in a window in the loft at
the top of the house, where it served him as a guide, and he was
able to find his way home by the light.  When he came to the door
the mistress came to meet him and bade him welcome.

"You have earned great glory," she said, "and have saved me and
my household from a disgrace never to be redeemed if you had not
delivered us."

"I think I am much the same person as I was last evening when
you spoke so roughly to me," said Grettir.

"We knew not then the might that was in you," she said, "as we
know it now.  Everything in the house shall be yours, so far as
it is fitting for me to bestow and right for you to receive.  I
doubt not that Thorfinn will reward you in a better way when he
comes home."

"There is little that I want as a reward at present," said
Grettir.  "But I accept your offer until your husband returns.  I
think now that you will be able to sleep in peace undisturbed by
the berserks."

Grettir drank little before he retired and lay all night in his
armour.  In the morning, directly the day broke, all the men of
the island were called together to go forth and search for the
two berserks who had escaped.  They were found at the end of the
day lying under a rock, both dead from cold and from their
wounds; they were carried away and buried in a place on the shore
beneath the tide, with some loose stones over them, after which
the islanders returned home, feeling that they could live in
peace.  When Grettir came back to the house and met the mistress
he spoke a verse:

     "Near the surging sea the twelve lie buried.
     I stayed not my hand but slew them alone.
     Great lady!  what deed that is wrought by a man
     shall be sung of as worthy if this be deemed small."

She answered: "Certainly you are very unlike any other man now
living." She set him in the high seat and gave him the best of
everything.  So it remained until Thorfinn returned.


CHAPTER XX

THORFINN'S RETURN.  GRETTIR VISITS THE NORTH

When Yule-tide was past, Thorfinn made ready for his homeward
journey and dismissed his many guests with gifts.  He sailed with
all his men and landed near the place where the boat-houses were.

They saw a ship lying on the sand which they at once recognised
as his great boat.  Thorfinn had heard nothing of the vikings and
told his men to put him on shore, "for I suspect," he said, "that
they are not friends who have been at work here."

Thorfinn was the first to land, and went straight to the boat-
house, where he saw a craft which he knew at once to be that of
the berserks.  He said to his men: "I suspect that things have
taken place here such that I would give the whole island and
everything that is in it for them not to have happened."

They asked how that was.

"Vikings have been here, men whom I know as the worst in all
Norway, namely Thorir Paunch and Ogmund the Bad.  They will not
have dealt gently with us.  I mistrust that Icelander."

Then he spoke many things to his men.  Grettir was at home and
detained the men from going down to the shore.  He said he did
not care if the bondi got a little fright from what he saw.  The
goodwife asked his leave to go down, and he said she was mistress
of her own ways, but that he was not going.  So she hurried away
to greet Thorfinn and embraced him joyfully.  He was rejoiced to
see her and said: "God be praised that I see you well and my
daughter too.  But what has happened to you since I left?"

"It has ended well," she said.  "But we were nigh to suffering a
disgrace which could never have been wiped out, had not your
winter-guest aided us."

Thorfinn said: "Let us sit down and you shall tell me
everything."

Then she told him fully all that had happened, praising highly
Grettir's courage and resourcefulness.  Thorfinn was silent while
she was speaking, and when she had finished he said: "True indeed
is the word, `Long shall a man be tried'.  But where is Grettir?"

"He is at home in the hall," she answered.

Then they went up to the house.  Thorfinn went to Grettir and
turned towards him and thanked him with the fairest words for his
courageous conduct.

"I will say a word to you," he said, "which few would say to
their friend.  I would it might happen that you should need the
help of a man, for you to know whether I count for anything or
not; I cannot repay what you have done for me as long as you are
not in straits.  You shall have in my house whatever you desire,
and shall be in the highest honour in my household."

Grettir thanked him and said he would have accepted his offer
even if he had made it earlier.

Grettir stayed there the rest of the winter in high favour with
Thorfinn.  The fame of his deed spread through all Norway,
especially in those parts where the berserks had ravaged most
mercilessly.  In the spring Thorfinn asked him what he would like
to do.  He said he would go North to Vagar while the fair was on
there.  Thorfinn said that any money which he required should be
at his service; Grettir said he did not want more just then than
enough to pay for his living.  Thorfinn said that was his due,
and brought him to a ship, where he gave him the excellent short
sword.  Grettir kept it as long as he lived; it was a most
precious possession.  Thorfinn bade him come to him if ever he
wanted any help.

Grettir then travelled to Vagar, which was crowded with people. 
Many whom he had never set eyes on before greeted him warmly
because of his exploit in killing the vikings, and several of the
leading men invited him to stay with them, but he preferred to
return to his friend Thorfinn.  So he took his passage in a
trading ship belonging to one Thorkell, a man of some
consideration in Salfti in Halogaland.  Grettir went to visit
Thorkell in his home, where he received a hearty welcome and a
very pressing invitation to stay there for the winter.  Grettir
accepted the invitation and stayed the winter with Thorkell, who
treated him with great honour.


CHAPTER XXI

ADVENTURE WITH A BEAR

There was a man named Bjorn who was then on a visit to Thorkell. 
He was of a somewhat violent character of good family and related
in some way to Thorkell.  He was not generally liked, because he
was too much given to talking against the men who were about
Thorkell and drove many away from him.  He and Grettir did not
get on at all.  Bjorn thought him of small account compared to
himself; Grettir paid him little deference, and it became an open
feud.  Bjorn was a boisterous swaggering man, and many of the
younger men imitated him, loitering about outside in the
evenings.

It happened at the beginning of the winter that a savage brown
bear broke out of its den and raged about destroying men and
cattle.  Every one declared that it had been provoked by the
noise which Bjorn and his company made.  The beast became most
mischievous, attacking the flocks in the very face of the men
themselves.  Thorkell, being the wealthiest man of that part,
suffered most.  One day he called up his men to come with him and
search out the bear's den.  They found it in a cliff by the sea
where there was a cave under an overhanging rock, with a narrow
path leading to the entrance.  Below was a sheer precipice down
to the beach, threatening certain death to any one who stumbled. 
In this den the bear lay in the daytime, going abroad at night. 
Fences were of no avail against him, nor could the dogs do
anything, so that all were in the utmost distress.  Thorkell's
kinsman Bjorn declared that the main thing was gained now that
they had found the den.  "Now we shall see," he said, "how the
game will go with me and my namesake." Grettir pretended not to
hear what he said.

In the evenings when the others retired to bed, Bjorn used
generally to go out.  One night he went to the bear's den and
found the creature inside, growling horribly.  He lay down in the
path, placing his shield over him, intending to wait until the
beast came out as usual.  Bruin, however, got wind of him and was
rather slow in coming out.  Bjorn got very sleepy where he was
lying and could not keep awake; in the meantime out came the bear
from his den and saw a man lying there.  He clawed at him,
dragged off his shield and threw it down the cliff.  Bjorn woke
up, not a little startled, took to his heels and ran off home,
narrowly escaping the bear's clutches.  His friends knew all
about it, having watched his movements; on the next morning they
found the shield and made great game of his adventure.

At Yule-time Thorkell himself went out to the den with Bjorn,
Grettir and others of his men, a party of eight in all.  Grettir
had on a fur cape which he put off when they were attacking the
bear.  It was rather difficult to get at him, since they could
only reach him with spear-thrusts, which he parried with his
teeth.  Bjorn kept urging them on to tackle him, but himself did
not go near enough to be in any danger.  At last, when no one was
looking out, he took Grettir's fur cloak and threw it in to the
bear.  They did not succeed in getting the bear out, and when
night came on turned to go home.  Grettir then missed his cloak
and saw that the bear had got it into his grip.

"Who has been playing tricks on me?" he cried.  "Who threw my
cloak into the cave?"

Bjorn answered: "He who did it will not be afraid to say so."

"Things of that sort do not trouble me much," said Grettir.

Then they started on their way home.  After they had gone a
little way Grettir's garter broke.  Thorkell told them to wait
for him, but Grettir said it was not necessary.  Then Bjorn said:
"There is no need to suppose that Grettir will run away from his
cloak.  He wants to have the honour of killing the beast all
alone, and he will say that we eight men went away.  Then he
would appear to be what he is said to be.  He has been backward
enough all day."

"I don't know how you stand in that matter," said Thorkell.  "You
and he are not equal in valour; do not make any to-do about him."

Bjorn said that neither he nor Grettir should choose the words
out of his mouth.

There was a hill between them and Grettir, who had turned back
along the footpath.  Now he had no others to reckon with in
making the attack.  He drew his sword Jokulsnaut and tied a loop
round the handle which he passed over his wrist, because he
thought that he could carry out his plans better if his hand were
free.  He went along the path.  When the bear saw a man coming,
he charged savagely, and struck at him with the paw that was on
the side away from the precipice.  Grettir aimed a blow at him
with his sword and cut off his paw just above the claws.  Then
the creature tried to strike him with his sound paw, but to do so
he had to drop on the stump, which was shorter than he expected,
and over he fell into Grettir's embraces.  Grettir seized the
beast by the ears and held him off so that he could not bite.  He
always said that he considered this holding back the bear the
greatest feat of strength that he ever performed.  The beast
struggled violently; the space was very narrow, and they both
fell over the precipice.  The bear being the heavier came down
first on the beach; Grettir fell on the top of him, and the bear
was badly mauled on the side that was down.  Grettir got his
sword, ran it into the heart of the bear and killed him.  Then he
went home, after fetching his cloak which was torn to pieces.  He
also took with him the bit of the paw which he had cut off.

Thorkell was sitting and drinking when Grettir entered.  They all
laughed at the ragged cloak which he was wearing.  Then he laid
the piece of the paw upon the table.  Thorkell said: "Where is
my kinsman Bjorn?  I never saw iron bite like that in your hands.

Now I would like you to show Grettir some honour to make up for
the shame which you cast upon him."

Bjorn said that could wait, and that it mattered little to him
whether Grettir was pleased or not.  Grettir then spoke a verse:

     "Oft returned the watcher at night
     trembling home, but sound in limb.
     None ever saw me sit in the dusk
     at the cave; yet now I am home returned."

"It is true," said Bjorn, "that you have fought well; and also
true that our opinions differ.  I suppose you think that your
taunts hurt me."

Thorkell said: "I should be glad, Grettir, if you would not
revenge yourself upon Bjorn.  I will pay the full weregild of a
man for you to be reconciled."

Bjorn said he might invest his money better than in paying for
that; and that it would be better for him and Grettir to go on
bickering since "each oak has that which it scrapes from the
other."  Thorkell said: "But I ask you, Grettir, to do so much
for my sake as not to attack Bjorn while you are both with me."

"That I promise," said Grettir.

Bjorn said that he would walk without fear of Grettir wherever
they met.  Grettir grinned, and would accept no money on account
of Bjorn.  They stayed there the winter.


CHAPTER XXII

GRETTIR KILLS BJORN AND IS SUMMONED BEFORE JARL SVEINN

In the spring Grettir went North to Vagar with Thorkell's men. 
They parted with friendship.  Bjorn went West to England in
Thorkell's ship, of which he was master, staying there for the
summer and transacting the business which Thorkell had entrusted
to him.  In the end of the autumn he returned from the western
parts.  Grettir stayed in Vagar till the trading ships left, and
then sailed South with some of the traders, as far as the port of
Gartar at the mouth of the Thrandheim's Fjord, where he set up
the awnings to make a stay.  When they were settled down a ship
came up along the coast from the South, which they at once
recognised as one of the ships from England.  She made fast
further out off the coast and her crew landed.  Grettir went out
with his companions to visit them.  On their meeting Grettir
found Bjorn amongst the company and said: "It is well that we
meet here, for now we can continue our former quarrel.  I should
like to try which of us is the better man."

Bjorn said that was all past now, as far as he was concerned. 
"But," he said, "if there has been anything between us I will pay
you such compensation that you shall be satisfied." Grettir spoke
a verse:

     "Time was when the bear was slain by my hand;
     my cloak in tatters was torn.
     A rascally knave was the cause of it all
     but now he shall make me amends."

Bjorn said that weightier matters than this had been settled by
payment.  Grettir said that few men had any reason to act
maliciously towards him; he had accepted no money-atonement, nor
would he do so now; that if he had his way they should not both
go away unhurt, and that if Bjorn refused to fight he would brand
him as a coward.  Bjorn saw that excuses would not avail him, so
he took his arms and went out.  They rushed at each other and
fought; soon Bjorn was wounded and then he fell dead to the
ground.  On seeing that, his men went on board their ship, sailed
away to the North along the coast to Thorkell's place and told
him what had happened.  He said it had not come sooner than he
expected.  Directly afterwards he sailed to the South to
Thrandheim where he found jarl Sveinn.

Grettir, after slaying Bjorn, went to More to his friend Thorfinn
and told him exactly what had happened.  Thorfinn received him in
a most friendly way.  "I am glad," he said, "that you will now
have need of a friend.  You must stay with me until this affair
is finished."

Grettir thanked him for his invitation and said be would accept
it.

Jarl Sveinn was staying at Steinker in Thrandheim when he heard
of the Slaying of Bjorn.  With him was a brother of Bjorn named
Hjarrandi, as one of his bodyguard.  On hearing of Bjorn's death
he became very angry and begged the jarl for his support in the
matter, which the jarl promised that he should have.  He sent
messengers to Thorfinn to summon both him and Grettir to appear
before him.  Immediately on receiving the jarl's commands they
both made ready and came to Thrandheim.  The jarl held a council
on the matter and ordered Hjarrandi to be present.  Hjarrandi
said he was not going to weigh his brother against his purse, and
that he must either follow him or avenge him.

When the case was looked into, it became evident that Bjorn had
given Grettir many provocations.  Thorfinn offered to pay a fine
such as the jar] thought suitable to the position of his kinsman,
and dwelt at length upon Grettir's achievement in killing the
berserks, and how he had delivered the men in the North from
them.

The jarl answered: "Truth do you speak, Thorfinn!  that was
indeed a cleansing!  It would befit us well to accept the
compensation for your sake.  Grettir, too, is a fine fellow, and
noted for his strength and valour."

Hjarrandi, however, would accept no compensation, and the meeting
came to an end.  Thorfinn appointed one of his kinsmen, Arnbjorn,
to accompany Grettir every day, for he knew that Hjarrandi was
plotting against his life.


CHAPTER XXIII

GRETTIR KILLS HJARRANDI

One day Grettir and Arnbjorn were walking along the road for
their diversion when they passed a gate, whence a man rushed out
holding an axe aloft with both hands and struck at Grettir, who
was not on his guard and was moving slowly.  Arnbjorn, however,
saw the man coming, seized Grettir and pushed him aside with such
force that he fell on his knee.  The axe struck him in the
shoulder-blade and cut down to below the arm, inflicting a severe
wound.  Grettir turned quickly and drew his sword; he saw that it
was Hjarrandi who had attacked him.  The axe had stuck fast in
the road, and Hjarrandi was slow in recovering it.  Grettir
struck at him and cut off his arm at the shoulder.  Then there
came running up five of Hjarrandi's followers and a battle began
with them.  They were soon routed; Grettir and Arnbjorn killed
the five who were with Hjarrandi; one man escaped and bore the
tale to the jarl forthwith.  The jarl was very angry indeed, and
summoned the assembly for the next day.  Thorfinn and his party
appeared thereat.  The jarl brought a charge of manslaughter
against Grettir, who admitted it and said that he had been
obliged to defend himself.  "I bear the marks of it," he said. 
"I should have been killed if Arnbjorn had not defended me."

The jarl said it was a pity he had not been killed, for this
affair would lead to many a man being slain if he lived.

There had come to the jarl's court Bersi the son of Skaldtorfa,
Grettir's comrade and friend.  He and Thorfinn stepped before the
jarl and begged for pardon for Grettir.  They asked that the jarl
should decide the matter himself as he thought best, only that
Grettir should have his life and the freedom of the country.  The
jarl was averse to any terms being granted to him, but gave way
to their entreaties.  He granted immunity to Grettir until the
spring, but not absolutely until Gunnar the brother of Bjorn and
Hjarrandi should be present.  Gunnar was a landed proprietor in
Tunsberg.

In the spring the jarl ordered Grettir and Thorfinn to appear at
Tunsberg, where he himself intended to be while the shipping was
assembled.  So thither they went, and found the jarl was already
in the town.  There Grettir met his brother Thorsteinn Dromund,
who greeted him joyfully and invited him to be his guest.  He was
a landowner in the town.  Grettir told him all about his case,
and Thorsteinn took his view of it, but told him to beware of
Gunnar.  So the spring passed.


CHAPTER XXIV

GRETTIR KILLS GUNNAR.  HIS FRIENDS RALLY ROUND HIM AND SAVE HIM
FROM THE VENGEANCE OF THE JARL

Gunnar was in the town and was plotting against Grettir's life. 
Wherever he went Gunnar dogged his steps wherever he found a
chance of getting near him.  One day Grettir was sitting in a
booth and drinking, because he wanted to keep out of Gunnar's
way.  Suddenly there was a bang at the door, so hard that it
broke in pieces, and in rushed four men armed and attacked
Grettir.  They were Gunnar with his followers.  Grettir seized
his arms which were hanging above his head and ran into a corner,
where he defended himself, holding his shield before him, and
hewing with his sword.  They made little way against him.  One
blow he succeeded in delivering upon one of Gunnar's followers,
who needed nothing more.  Then Grettir advanced, driving them
before him out of the booth, and killing another of them.  Gunnar
would fain have got away with his men, but on reaching the door
he caught his foot on the doorstep, fell over and was not able to
recover himself at once.  He held his shield before him and
retreated as Grettir pressed him hard.  Then Grettir sprang on to
the crossbenches near the door.  Gunnar's hands and the shield
were still inside the door, and Grettir struck down between him
and the shield, cutting off both his hands at the wrist.  He fell
backwards out of the door, and Grettir gave him his death-blow. 
Then the man who was behind him got on his feet and ran off at
once to tell the jarl what had happened.  Sveinn was furious, and
called the assembly to meet there and then in the town.  When
Thorfinn and Thorsteinn Dromund heard the news, they called all
their followers and friends together and went to the meeting in
force.  The jarl was very wroth, and it was no easy matter to get
speech with him.  Thorfinn was the first to come before the jarl,
and he said: "I have come to offer an honourable atonement for
the man who has been slain by Grettir.  The judgment shall remain
with you alone if you but spare his life."

The jarl replied in great wrath: "It is too late to beg for
Grettir's life, and you have no case that I can see.  He has
killed three brothers, one at the feet of the other; men of noble
minds who would not weigh each other against their purses.  Now,
Thorfinn, it will not avail you to beg for Grettir; I will not do
such a wrong in the land as to accept atonement for such a crime
as this."

Then Bersi the son of Skaldtorfa came up and begged the jarl to
accept blood-money.  "Grettir," he said, "is a man of high
birth and is my good friend.  I offer you what I possess.  May
you see, my lord, that it is better by sparing one man to earn
the goodwill of many and to fix the penalty yourself than to
refuse honourable terms and risk whether you can arrest the man
or not."

The jarl replied: "You do right, Bersi; and herein as ever you
show your worth.  But I do not mean to break the laws of the land
by granting life to a man who has forfeited it."

Then Thorsteinn Dromund came forward, and he, too, offered
blood-money on behalf of Grettir, adding many fair words thereto.

The jarl asked what moved him to offer blood-money for the man. 
Thorsteinn said Grettir was his brother.  The jarl said he had
not known that.

"It shows a manly spirit in you," he said, "that you want to help
him.  But as I am determined not to accept blood-money in this
case, I must treat the requests of all of you alike.  I must
have Grettir's life whatever it cost, directly I can get him."

Then the jarl rose quickly up and refused to hear any more about
atonement.  They all went home with Thorsteinn and made their
preparations, whereupon the jarl ordered all the men of his guard
under arms and went forth with a large force.  Before they came
up, Grettir's friends had made ready to defend the house. 
Thorfinn, Thorsteinn, Grettir himself, and Bersi were in the
forefront, each with a large force of followers behind him.  The
jarl summoned them to give up Grettir, and not to bring trouble
on themselves.  They repeated their former offers, but the jarl
would not listen to them.  Thorfinn and Thorsteinn said that more
was at stake for the jarl than the taking of Grettir's life. 
"One fate shall fall upon us all," they cried, "and men shall say
that you have given much for the life of one man when we are all
laid low with the ground."

The jarl said he would spare none of them, and they were on the
very verge of a battle when many of the well-disposed men came up
to him and begged him not to land himself in such a difficulty. 
He should bear in mind that these men would work great havoc
among his own followers before they fell.  The jarl thought this
counsel was wise and let himself be somewhat appeased.  Then the
terms of atonement were settled.  Thorfinn and Thorsteinn were
ready to pay so long as Grettir's life was spared.  The jarl
said: "You must know that although I agree to this compromise, I
do not consider it a full amnesty.  Only I have no mind to fight
against my own men, although they appear to hold me of little
account in the matter."

Thorfinn said: "Yours is all the greater honour, my lord, that
you will have the fixing of the penalty yourself."

The jarl said that Grettir should have leave from him to depart
from the country in peace for Iceland, directly there was a ship
leaving, if so it seemed good to them.  They agreed and paid the
money to the jarl to his satisfaction.  They parted with little
friendship.  Grettir went with Thorfinn after bidding an
affectionate farewell to his brother Thorsteinn.

Thorfinn earned great honour for the support which he had given
Grettir against such odds as he had to deal with.  Not one of the
men who had helped Grettir was ever received into favour again
with the jarl, excepting Bersi.

Grettir then spoke:

     "Comrade of Odin, Thorfinn was born
     to rescue my life from the fangs of Hel.
     No less was Thorsteinn Dromund's aid
     when I was doomed to the realm of the dead."

And again:

     "The prince's retainers withdrew in fear
     when Bersi threatened their hearts to pierce."

Grettir returned with Thorfinn to the North and stayed with him
until he found a ship with some traders who were bound for
Iceland.  Thorfinn gave him many valuable garments and a coloured
saddle with a bridle.  They parted with friendship, and Thorfinn
invited him to come and see him if ever he returned to Norway.


CHAPTER XXV

EVENTS IN ICELAND.  THORGILS MAKSSON ATTACKED BY THE FOSTER-
BROTHERS AND SLAIN

Asmund Longhair was in Bjarg whilst Grettir was away, and was
much respected as a bondi in Midfjord.  Thorkell Krafla had died
during Grettir's absence.  Thorvald Asgeirsson dwelt in Ass in
Vatnsdal and was a great chief.  He was the father of Dalla who
married Isleif, afterwards bishop in Skalaholt.  Asmund had great
support from Thorvald in legal suits and in other matters.

There grew up in Asmund's household a youth named Thorgils
Maksson, a near kinsman of his.  Thorgils was a strong man of his
body and made much money under Asmund's guidance; he dwelt at
Laekjamot, on a property which Asmund had bought for him. 
Thorgils was a good manager and went to Strandir every year,
where he obtained whales and other things.  He was a man of great
courage, and went as far as the eastern Almenningar.  At that
time the two foster-brothers Thorgeir Havarsson and Thormod
Coalbrow-Skald were very much to the front; they kept a boat,
gathering what they wanted from the country around, and had not
the reputation of dealing fairly.

One summer Thorgils Maksson found a whale at the Almenningar and
went out at once with his men to cut it up.  When the two
foster-brothers heard of it they went there too, and at first it
seemed as if matters would be settled peaceably.  Thorgils
proposed that they should share equally that part of the whale
which was yet uncut, but they wanted to have all the uncut part
or else to share the entire whale.  Thorgils positively refused
to give up any portion of what had already been cut.  They began
to use threats and at last took to their arms and fought. 
Thorgeir and Thorgils fought each of them desperately together
without either prevailing.  After a long and furious battle
Thorgils fell slain by Thorgeir.  In another place Thormod was
fighting with the followers of Thorgils, and he overcame them,
killing three.  Those who remained of Thorgils' party went off
after he fell to Midfjord, taking his body with them and feeling
that they had suffered a great loss.  The foster-brothers took
possession of the whole whale.  The affair is referred to in the
memorial poem which Thormod composed upon Thorgeir.

News of the death of his kinsman was brought to Asmund Longhair,
on whom as nearest of kin the blood-feud devolved.  He went to
the spot, called witnesses to testify to the wounds and brought
the case before the All-Thing, which appeared to be the proper
course in this case where the act had been committed in another
quarter.  Some time was passed over this.


CHAPTER XXVI

THE FEUD WITH THE FOSTER-BROTHERS IS TAKEN UP BY ASMUND AND
THORSTEINN KUGGASON

There was a man named Thorsteinn; he was the son of Thorkell
Kuggi, the son of Thord Yeller, the son of Olaf Feilan, the son
of Thorsteinn the Red, the son of Aud the Deep-Minded. 
Thorsteinn Kuggason's mother was Thurid, daughter of Asgeir
Hothead.  Asgeir was the brother of Asmund Longhair's father. 
Thorsteinn Kuggason was equally responsible in the blood-feud
over Thorgils' death with Asmund Longhair, who now sent for him. 
Thorsteinn was a great warrior and very masterful.  He came at
once to his kinsman Asmund and they had a talk together about the
suit.  Thorsteinn was for extreme measures.  He said that no
blood-money should be accepted; that with their connections they
were powerful enough to carry through a sentence of either
banishment or death on the slayer.  Asmund said he would support
any measures whatever that he chose to adopt.  They rode then
North to Thorvald their kinsman and asked for his support, which
he at once promised them.  So the suit was begun against Thorgeir
and Thormod.  Thorsteinn then rode home to his dwelling at
Ljarskogar in the Hvamm district.  Skeggi in Hvamm also joined
Thorsteinn.  He was a son of Thorarin Fylsenni, a son of Thord
the Yeller.  His mother was Fridgerd, a daughter of Thord from
Hofdi.  They had a large following at the All-Thing and pressed
their suit valiantly.  Asmund and Thorvald rode from the North
with sixty men, halting several days at Ljarskogar.


CHAPTER XXVII

SENTENCES ON THE FOSTER-BROTHERS

There dwelt at Reykjaholar a man named Thorgils, the son of Ari,
the son of Mar, the son of Atli the Red, the son of Ulf Squint-
Eye, the first settler at Reykjanes.  Thorgils' mother was
Thorgerd the daughter of Alf of Dalir.  Alf had another daughter
named Thorelf, who was the mother of Thorgeir the son of Havar. 
Thorgeir, therefore, had a very strong backing through his
connections, for Thorgils was the most powerful chief in the
Vestfirding quarter.  He was very open-handed and gave
hospitality to any free-man for as long as he would.  There was
consequently always a crowd at Reykjaholar, and he lived in great
grandeur.  He was both kindly and wise.  Thorgeir stayed with him
in the winter and went to Strandir in the summer.

After slaying Thorgils the son of Mak, Thorgeir went to
Reykjaholar and told Thorgils Arason what had happened.  Thorgils
told him his house was open to him.  "But," he said, "they will
press the matter vigorously, and I am most unwilling to involve
myself in difficulties.  I will send a man now to Thorsteinn and
offer him blood-money for the Thorgils affair; if he will not
accept it I will not adopt any violent measures."

Thorgeir declared that he would submit to his wisdom.  In the
autumn Thorgils sent a messenger to Thorsteinn Kuggason to try
and arrange a settlement.  Thorsteinn was very disinclined to
accept any money in atonement for the slaying of Thorgils,
although for the others he was willing to follow the advice of
men of counsel.  Thorgils on receiving the report of his
messenger called Thorgeir to a consultation with him and asked
him what support he thought was proper.  Thorgeir said that if a
sentence of banishment were passed upon him he would go. Thorgils
said that his resolve would be put to the trial.

There came a ship into the Nordra river in Borgarfjord, and
Thorgils secretly took a passage in her for the two foster-
brothers.  The winter now passed, and Thorgils heard that
Thorsteinn and his party had assembled in great force for the
All-Thing and were then in Ljarskogar.  So he put off his
departure, intending that they should arrive from the North
before he came up from the West.  So it came to pass.  Thorgils
and Thorgeir then rode towards the South, Thorgeir killing one
Boggul-Torfi on the way at Marskelda and two other men named Skuf
and Bjarni at Hundadal.  Thormod sings about this affair in his
Thorgeir's drapa:

     "The hem slew the son of Mak;
     there was storm of swords and raven's food.
     Skuf and Bjami he also felled;
     gladly he bathed his hands in blood."

Thorgils settled for the slaying of Skuf and Bjarni there and
then in the dale, and was delayed by the affair longer than he
intended.  Thorgeir embarked on the ship and Thorgils went to the
Thing, where he did not arrive before they were proceeding to
judgment in Thorgils Maksson's case.  Asmund Longhair then called
for the defence.  Thorgils appeared before the court and offered
blood-money in atonement on condition of Thorgeir not being
sentenced to banishment.  He endeavoured to meet the charge by
pleading that finds in the Almenningar were free to all.  The
question whether this was a valid defence or not was referred to
the Lawman, who at that time was Skapti.  He upheld Asmund's view
on account of their kinship together.  He declared that this was
indeed the law in the case of men equal in position, but that a
bondi had precedence over a vagrant.  Asmund further urged that
Thorgils had offered to share the uncut portion of the whale with
the foster-brothers when they arrived.  The defendants were
non-suited on that point.  Then Thorsteinn and his party pressed
their suit resolutely and said they would not be satisfied with
any sentence short of banishment upon Thorgeir.  Thorgils saw
that no choice was left to him but either to call up his men and
try to carry his case with violence, the issue of which would be
uncertain, or else to submit to the sentence demanded by the
opposite party, and since Thorgeir was already on board his ship
Thorgils had no desire to press the case further.  Thorgeir was
banished, but Thormod was discharged upon payment of blood-money.

Asmund and Thorsteinn gained great glory by this case.  The men
rode home from the Thing.  There were some who said that Thorgils
had not taken much trouble in the case, but he paid little
attention and let them say what they pleased.

When Thorgeir heard that he was banished, he said that if he had
his way, those who had brought it about should be repayed in full
before it was over.

There was a man named Gaut, called the son of Sleita, a kinsman
of Thorgils Maksson.  He was intending to travel in the same ship
with Thorgeir, with whom he was on very bad terms, and frowned on
him.  The traders thought it would never do to have them both
together in the ship.  Thorgeir said he did not care what Gaut
did with his eyebrows.  Nevertheless they decided that Gaut
should leave the ship.  He went into the northern districts and
for that time nothing happened, but the affair brought about a
feud between them which broke out later.


CHAPTER XXVIII

GRETTIR'S VISIT TO AUDUN IN VIDIDAL; OFFERS HIS SERVICES TO BARDI

In the course of that summer Grettir Asmundsson returned to
Skagafjord.  He had such a reputation for strength that none of
the younger men was supposed to be his equal.  He soon came to
his home in Bjarg, and Asmund gave him a fitting welcome.  Atli
was then managing the property and the brothers agreed well
together, but Grettir became so over-weening that he thought
nothing was beyond his powers.

Many of the youths with whom Grettir had played at Midfjordsvatn
before he left were now grown up.  Audun, the son of Asgeir, the
son of Audun, was now living at Audunarstad in Vididal.  He was a
good bondi and a kindly man, and was the strongest of all the men
in the northern parts, as well as the most modest.

Grettir had not forgotten how he had seemingly been worsted by
Audun at the ball-play, as related above, and he was anxious to
try which of them had gained most since.  With this object he
went at the beginning of the hay-harvest to Audunarstad.  Grettir
put on all his finery and rode with the coloured and richly
ornamented saddle which Thorfinn had given him, on a splendid
horse and in his best armour to Audun's place, where he arrived
early in the day and knocked at the door.  Few of the men were
in the house, and to Grettir's question whether Audun was at
home, they replied that he had gone to the hill-dairy to bring
home some produce.  Grettir took the bridle off his horse.  The
hay had not been mown in the meadow and the horse went for the
part where the grass was thickest.  Grettir entered the room and
sat down on the bench, where he fell asleep.  Soon Audun returned
home and saw a horse in the meadow with a coloured saddle on its
back.  He was bringing two horses loaded with curds in skins tied
at the mouth -- so-called "curd-bags."  Audun took the skins off
the horses and was carrying them in his arms so that he could not
see in front of him.  Grettir's leg was stretched out before him
and Audun stumbled over it, falling on the curd-bags which broke
at the neck.  Audun sprang up and asked what rascal that was in
his house.  Grettir told him his name.

"That was very awkward of you," said Audun.  "But what do you
want here?"

"I want to fight with you."

"First I must look after my dairy produce," Audun said.

"You can do that," answered Grettir, "if you have no one else to
do it for you."

Audun bent down, gathered up the skin and threw it right into
Grettir's breast, telling him to take what he sent him.  Grettir
was all covered with curds, and felt more disgusted than at any
wound which Audun could have given him.  Then they went for each
other and wrestled pretty smartly.  Grettir rushed at him, but
Audun escaped his grasp.  He saw, however, that Grettir had
gained upon him.  They drove up and down the room, overthrowing
everything that was near them.  Neither of them spared himself,
but Grettir had the advantage, and at last Audun fell, after
tearing off all Grettir's weapons.  They struggled hard and the
din was terrific.

Then there was a loud noise below.  Grettir heard a man ride up
to the house, get off his horse and come quickly inside.  He saw
a handsome man in a red jacket wearing a helmet.  Hearing the
commotion going on in the room where they were wrestling, he
came in and asked what was in the room.  Grettir told him his
name; "but who is it that wants to know?" he asked.

"My name is Bardi," answered the stranger.

"Are you Bardi the son of Gudmund from Asbjarnarnes?"

"The same," he replied.  "But what are you after?"

Grettir said: "I and Audun are playing here."

"I don't know about your play," said Bardi.  "But you are not
alike.  You are overbearing and insolent, while he is modest and
good-natured.  Let him get up at once."

Grettir said: "Many a man seizes the lock for the door.  You
would do better to avenge your brother Hall than to come between
me and Audun when we are contending."

"I am always hearing that," said Bardi, "and I don't know whether
I shall ever obtain my vengeance.  But I want you to leave Audun
in peace, for he is a quiet man."

Grettir said he was willing to do so because of Bardi's
intercession, though he did not like it much.  Bardi asked what
they were contending about.  Grettir replied in a verse:

     "I know not if for all your pride
     he may not try your throat to squeeze.
     Thus when within my home I dwelt
     did he once belabour me."

Bardi said there was certainly some excuse if he was taking
revenge.  "Let me now settle it between you," he said.  "Let
matters remain as they are and cease your strife."

So they consented, for they were kinsmen.  But Grettir had little
liking for Bardi or his brothers.  They all rode away together. 
On the way Grettir said: "I hear, Bardi, that you intend to go
South to Borgarfjord this summer; I propose that I shall go with
you, which I think is more than you deserve."

Bardi was very pleased with this offer, and at once accepted it
most thankfully.  Then they parted.  Bardi then turned back and
said to Grettir: "I would like it to be understood that you only
come with me if it meets with Thorarin's approval, since all the
arrangements for the expedition are with him."

"I thought," said Grettir, "you were competent to make your
arrangements for yourself.  I do not leave my affairs to other
people to settle.  I shall take it very ill if you refuse me."

Then each went his own way.  Bardi promised to send Grettir word
"if Thorarin wished him to go."  Otherwise he could remain
quietly at home.  Grettir then rode to Bjarg and Bardi to his own
home.


CHAPTER XXIX

HORSE-FIGHT AT LANGAFIT

That summer there was a great horse-fight at Langafit below
Reykir, whither a great many people came together.  Atli of Bjarg
had a good stallion of Keingala's race; grey with a dark stripe
down his back.  Both father and son valued the horse highly.  The
two brothers Kormak and Thorgils in Mel had a very mettlesome
brown stallion, and they arranged to match it against that of
Atli from Bjarg.  Many other excellent stallions were brought. 
Odd the Needy-Skald, Kormak's kinsman, had the charge of their
horse on the day.  He had grown into a strong man and had a high
opinion of himself; he was surly and reckless.  Grettir asked
Atli who should have charge of his stallion.

"That is not so clear to me," said Atli.

"Would you like me to back him?"

"Then you must keep very cool, kinsman," he said.  "We have men
to deal with who are rather overbearing."

"Let them pay for their bluster," he said, "if they cannot
control it."

The stallions were led out and the mares tethered together in the
front on the bank of the river.  There was a large pool just
beyond the bank.  The horses fought vigorously and there was
excellent sport.  Odd managed his horse pluckily and Grettir gave
way before him, holding the tail of his horse with one hand and
with the other the stick with which he pricked it on.  Odd stood
in the front by his horse, and one could not be sure that he was
not pricking off Atli's horse from his own.  Grettir pretended
not to notice it.  The horses then came near the river.  Then Odd
thrust with his pointed stick at Grettir and caught him in the
shoulder-blade which Grettir was turning towards him.  He struck
pretty hard, and the flesh swelled up, but Grettir was little
hurt.  At the same moment the horses reared.  Grettir ducked
beneath the flank of his horse and drove his stick into Odd's
side with such violence that three of his ribs were broken and
Odd fell into the pool with his horse and all the mares that were
tethered there by the bank.  Some people swam out and rescued
them.  There was great excitement about it.  Kormak's men on one
side and those of Bjarg on the other seized their arms, but the
men of Hrutafjord and Vatnsnes came between them and parted them.

They all went home in great wrath, but kept quiet for a time. 
Atli said very little, but Grettir rather swaggered and said that
they should meet again if he had his way.


CHAPTER XXX

THORBJORN OXMAIN AND THE FRAY AT HRUTAFJARDARHALS

There was living in Thoroddsstad in Hrutafjord a man named
Thorbjorn.  He was the son of Arnor Downy-Nose, the son of
Thorodd who had settled in that side of Hrutafjord which lies
opposite to Bakki.  Thorbjorn was of all men the strongest, and
was called Oxmain.  He had a brother named Thorodd, called
Drapustuf.  Their mother was Gerd, daughter of Bodvar from
Bodvarsholar.  Thorbjorn was a great swashbuckler and kept a
large troop of followers.  He was noted for being worse at
getting servants than other men, and scarcely paid them any
wages.  He was not a man easy to deal with.  There was a kinsman
of his, also named Thorbjorn, called Slowcoach.  He was a
mariner, and the two namesakes were in partnership together.  He
was always at Thoroddsstad and people did not think he made
Thorbjorn any better.  He liked to talk scandal and spoke
offensively of several men.

There was a man named Thorir, a son of Thorkell, at Bordeyr.  He
first lived at Melar in Hrutafjord, and had a daughter named
Helga who married Sleitu-Helgi.  After the Fagrabrekka affair
Thorir went South to Haukadal and lived in Skard, selling the
property at Melar to Thorhall the Winelander, the son of Gamli. 
Thorhall's son Gamli married Rannveig, the daughter of Asmund
Longhair, Grettir's sister.  They lived at that time in Melar and
had a good establishment.  Thorir of Skard had two sons, Gunnar
and Thorgeir, both promising men, who took over the property from
their father, but were always with Thorbjorn Oxmain, and became
very overbearing.

In the summer of that year Kormak and Thorgils rode with a
kinsman of theirs named Narfi South to Nordrardal on some
business.  Odd the Needy-Skald had recovered from the hurts
which he had received at the horse-fight and was of the party. 
While they were south of the heath Grettir was journeying from
his home at Bjarg with two of Atli's men.  They rode to Burfell
and then across the neck to Hrutafjord, reaching Melar in the
evening, where they spent three nights.  Rannveig and Gamli gave
Grettir a friendly reception and invited him to stay, but he
wanted to return home.  Then Grettir learned of Kormak's company
having come from the South, and that they were staying at Tunga
at night.  He prepared to leave Melar at once, and Gamli offered
to send some of his men with him.  Gamli's brother Grim, who was
very smart and active, and another rode with Grettir.  The party,
five in number, came to Hrutafjardarhals to the west of Burfell,
where the great stone called Grettishaf lies; he struggled a long
time with that stone, trying to lift it, and delayed his journey
thereby until Kormak's party came up.  Grettir went towards them
and both alighted from their horses.  Grettir said it would be
more seemly for free men to set to work with all their might
instead of fighting with sticks like tramps.  Kormak told them to
take up the challenge like men and to do their best.  So they
went for each other.  Grettir was in front of his men and told
them to see that nobody got behind him.  They fought for a time
and both were hurt.

On the same day Thorbjorn Oxmain had ridden across the neck to
Burfell, and as he returned with Thorbjorn Slowcoach, Gunnar and
Thorgeir, the sons of Thorir, and Thorodd Drapustuf, he saw the
fight going on.  On coming up, Thorbjorn called upon his men to
go between them, but they were struggling so furiously that
nobody could get at them.  Grettir was making a clean sweep of
everything round him.  Before him were the sons of Thorir.  He
pushed them back and they both fell over.  This made them
furious, and the consequence was that Gunnar gave a blow to one
of Atli's men which killed him.  Thorbjorn on seeing that ordered
them to separate, saying that he would give his support to
whichever side obeyed him.  By then two of Kormak's men had
fallen.  Grettir saw that it would scarcely do if Thorbjorn
joined the opposite side, so he gave up the battle.  All those
who had fought were wounded.  Grettir was much disgusted at their
being separated, but both parties rode home and were not
reconciled on this occasion.

Thorbjorn Slowcoach made great game of all this, and the
relations between the men of Bjarg and Thorbjorn Oxmain became
strained in consequence, until at last there was a regular feud,
which however broke out later.  No compensation was offered to
Atli for his man, and he went on as if he knew nothing of it. 
Grettir stayed at Bjarg till the Tvi-month.  It is not known that
he and Kormak ever met again; at least it is not mentioned
anywhere.


CHAPTER XXXI

GRETTIR'S VAIN ENDEAVOUR TO PROVOKE BARDI

Bardi the son of Gudmund and his brothers rode home to
Asbjarnarnes when they left Grettir.  They were the sons of
Gudmund the son of Solmund.  Solmund's mother was Thorlaug,
daughter of Saemund the Southerner, the foster-brother of
Ingimund the Old.  Bardi was a man of great distinction.  Soon he
went to see his foster-father Thorarin the Wise, who welcomed him
and asked what help he had been able to obtain, for Bardi's
journey had been arranged beforehand by them both.  Bardi
answered that he had engaged a man whose help he thought worth
more than that of two others.  Thorarin was silent for a moment
and then said: "That must be Grettir the son of Asmund."

"The guess of the wise is truth," said Bardi.  "That is the very
man, my foster-father."

Thorarin answered: "It is true that Grettir is beyond all other
men of whom there is now choice in the country; nor will he be
easily subdued by arms so long as he is sound.  But great
arrogance is in him now, and I have misgivings as to his luck. 
It is important for you that all your men on your expedition are
not men of an evil star.  It is enough if he does not fare with
you.  He shall not come if my counsel is followed."

"I did not expect, my foster-father," said he, "that you would
deny me the man who is bravest in all that he undertakes.  A man
in such straits as I seem to be in cannot provide against
everything."

"It will be better for you," he replied, "to let me provide."

So it came about that as Thorarin desired, word was not sent to
Grettir.  Bardi went to the South and the battle of the Heath was
fought.

Grettir was at Bjarg when he received the news that Bardi had
started on his expedition.  He was very angry that word had not
been sent to him, and said it should not end there.  He found out
when they were expected back from the South, and rode off to
Thoreyjargnup, where he meant to lie in wait for Bardi and his
men as they rode back.  He left the homestead behind and remained
at the cliffs.  On that day rode Bardi back from the battle of
the Heath from Tvidaegra; there were six of them in his party,
all sorely wounded.  When they came to the homestead Bardi said:
"There is a man up there on the cliff, very tall and armed.  Whom
do you take him for?"

They could not say who he was.  Bardi said: "I believe it is
Grettir the son of Asmund.  If it is, he will be wanting to meet
us, for I expect he is little pleased at not having been with us.

It seems to me that we are not in a very fit condition if he
wants to annoy us.  I will send home to Thoreyjargnup for some
men and not allow myself to be put out by his evil intentions."

They said that was the best thing he could do, and it was done. 
Bardi's party rode on; Grettir watched where they were going and
went there too.  They met and greeted each other.  Grettir asked
what the news was, and Bardi told him without hesitation. 
Grettir asked who had been with them.  Bardi answered that his
brothers and Eyjvolf his brother-inlaw had been with him.

"You have wiped out your disgrace," said Grettir.  "Now the next
thing is for us two here to try which is the stronger."

"I have more urgent business," said Bardi, "than to fight with
you about nothing.  I think I may be excused that now."

"It seems to me that you are afraid, Bardi; that is the reason
why you dare not fight me."

"Call it what you please.  If you wish to bully, find some one
else; that seems to be what you want, for your insolence passes
all bounds."

Grettir thought luck was against him.  He hesitated now whether
he should attack any of them; it seemed rather rash as they were
six and he was only one.  Then the men from Thoreyjargnup came up
and joined Bardi's party, so he left them and went back to his
horse.  Bardi and his men went on, and there was no greeting
between them when they parted.  We are not told that any strife
arose between Bardi and Grettir after this.

Grettir once said that he would trust himself to fight with most
men if there were not more than three against him.  Even with
four he would not give way without trying, but more he would not
attempt, except in self-defence.  Thus he says in a verse:

     "Oh skilled in war!  When three are before me
     I yet will endeavour to fight with them all.
     But more than four I dare not encounter
     in the clashing of arms, if the choice is with me."

On leaving Bardi, Grettir returned to Bjarg, and was much
aggrieved at finding nothing to try his strength on.  He sought
everywhere for something to fight with.


CHAPTER XXXII

THE SPOOK AT THORHALLSSTAD.  GLAM THE SHEPHERD KILLED BY A FIEND.

HIS GHOST WALKS

There was a man named Thorhall living in Thorhallsstad in
Forsaeludal, up from Vatnsdal.  He was the son of Grim, the son
of Thorhall, the son of Fridmund, who was the first settler in
Forsaeludal.  Thorhall's wife was named Gudrun; they had a son
named Grim and a daughter named Thurid who were just grown up. 
Thorhall was fairly wealthy, especially in live-stock.  His
property in cattle exceeded that of any other man.  He was not a
chief, but an honest bondi nevertheless.  He had great difficulty
in getting a shepherd to suit him because the place was haunted. 
He consulted many men of experience as to what he should do, but
nobody gave him any advice which was of any use.  Thorhall had
good horses, and went every summer to the Thing.  On one occasion
at the All-Thing he went to the booth of the Lawman Skapti the
son of Thorodd, who was a man of great knowledge and gave good
counsel to those who consulted him.  There was a great difference
between Thorodd the father and Skapti the son in one respect. 
Thorodd possessed second sight, but was thought by some not to be
straight, whereas Skapti gave to every man the advice which he
thought would avail him, if he followed it exactly, and so earned
the name of Father-betterer.

So Thorhall went to Skapti's booth, where Skapti, knowing that he
was a man of wealth, received him graciously, and asked what the
news was.

"I want some good counsel from you," said Thorhall.

"I am little fit to give you counsel," he replied; "but what is
it that you need?"

"It is this: I have great difficulty in keeping my shepherds. 
Some get injured and others cannot finish their work.  No one
will come to me if he knows what he has to expect."

Skapti answered: "There must be some evil spirit abroad if men
are less willing to tend your flocks than those of other men. 
Now since you have come to me for counsel, I will get you a
shepherd.  His name is Glam, and he came from Sylgsdale in Sweden
last summer.  He is a big strong man, but not to everybody's
mind."

Thorhall said that did not matter so long as he looked after the
sheep properly.  Skapti said there was not much chance of getting
another if this man with all his strength and boldness should
fail.  Then Thorhall departed.  This happened towards the end of
the Thing.

Two of Thorhall's horses were missing, and he went himself to
look for them, which made people think he was not much of a man. 
He went up under Sledaass and south along the hill called
Armannsfell.  Then he saw a man coming down from Godaskog
bringing some brushwood with a horse.  They met and Thorhall
asked him his name.  He said it was Glam.  He was a big man with
an extraordinary expression of countenance, large grey eyes and
wolfgrey hair.  Thorhall was a little startled when he saw him,
but soon found out that this was the man who had been sent to
him.

"What work can you do best?" he asked.

Glam said it would suit him very well to mind sheep in the
winter.

"Will you mind my sheep?" Thorhall asked.  "Skapti has given you
over to me."

"My service will only be of use to you if I am free to do as I
please," he said.  "I am rather crossgrained when I am not well
pleased."

"That will not hurt me," said Thorhall.  "I shall be glad if you
will come to me."

"I can do so," he said.  "Are there any special difficulties?"

"The place seems to be haunted."

"I am not afraid of ghosts.  It will be the less dull."

"You will have to risk it," said Thorhall.  "It will be best to
meet it with a bold face."

Terms were arranged and Glam was to come in the autumn.  Then
they parted.  Thorhall found his horses in the very place where
he had just been looking for them.  He rode home and thanked
Skapti for his service.

The summer passed.  Thorhall heard nothing of his shepherd and no
one knew anything about him, but at the appointed time he
appeared at Thorhallsstad.  Thorhall treated him kindly, but all
the rest of the household disliked him, especially the mistress. 
He commenced his work as shepherd, which gave him little trouble.

He had a loud hoarse voice.  The beasts all flocked together
whenever he shouted at them.  There was a church in the place,
but Glam never went to it.  He abstained from mass, had no
religion, and was stubborn and surly.  Every one hated him.

So the time passed till the eve of Yule-tide.  Glam rose early
and called for his meal.  The mistress said: "It is not proper
for Christian men to eat on this day, because to-morrow is
the first day of Yule and it is our duty to fast to-day."

"You have many superstitions," he said; "but I do not see that
much comes of them.  I do not know that men are any better off
than when there was nothing of that kind.  The ways of men seemed
to me better when they were called heathen.  I want my food and
no foolery."

"I am certain," she said, "that it will fare ill with you to-day
if you commit this sin."

Glam told her that she should bring his food, or that it would be
the worse for her.  She did not dare to do otherwise than as he
bade her.  When he had eaten he went out, his breath smelling
abominably.  It was very dark; there was driving snow, the wind
was howling and it became worse as the day advanced.  The
shepherd's voice was heard in the early part of the day, but less
later on.  Blizzards set in and a terrific storm in the evening. 
People went to mass and so the time passed.  In the evening Glam
did not return.  They talked about going out to look for him, but
the storm was so violent and the night so dark that no one went. 
The night passed and still he had not returned; they waited till
the time for mass came.  When it was full day some of the men set
forth to search.  They found the animals scattered everywhere in
the snow and injured by the weather; some had strayed into the
mountains.  Then they came upon some well-marked tracks up above
in the valley.  The stones and earth were torn up all about as if
there had been a violent tussle.  On searching further they came
upon Glam lying on the ground a short distance off.  He was dead;
his body was as black as Hel and swollen to the size of an ox. 
They were overcome with horror and their hearts shuddered within
them.  Nevertheless they tried to carry him to the church, but
could not get him any further than the edge of a gully a short
way off.  So they left him there and went home to report to the
bondi what had happened.  He asked what could have caused Glam's
death.  They said they had tracked him to a big place like a hole
made by the bottom of a cask thrown down and dragged along up
below the mountains which were at the top of the valley, and all
along the track were great drops of blood.  They concluded that
the evil spirit which had been about before must have killed
Glam, but that he had inflicted wounds upon it which were enough,
for that spook was never heard of again.  On the second day of
the festival they went out again to bring in Glam's body to the
church.  They yoked oxen to him, but directly the downward
incline ceased and they came to level ground, they could not move
him; so they went home again and left him.  On the third day they
took a priest with them, but after searching the whole day they
failed to find him.  The priest refused to go again, and when he
was not with them they found Glam.  So they gave up the attempt
to bring him to the church and buried him where he was under a
cairn of stones.

It was not long before men became aware that Glam was not easy in
his grave.  Many men suffered severe injuries; some who saw him
were struck senseless and some lost their wits.  Soon after the
festival was over, men began to think they saw him about their
houses.  The panic was great and many left the neighbourhood. 
Next he began to ride on the house-tops by night, and nearly
broke them to pieces.  Almost night and day he walked, and people
would scarcely venture up the valley, however pressing their
business.  The district was in a grievous condition.


CHAPTER XXXIII

DOINGS OF GLAM'S GHOST.  AWFUL CONDITION OF VATNSDAL

In the spring Thorhall procured servants and built a house on his
lands.  As the days lengthened out the apparitions became less,
until at midsummer a ship sailed up the Hunavatn in which was a
man named Thorgaut.  He was a foreigner, very tall and powerful;
he had the strength of two men.  He was travelling on his own
account, unattached, and being without money was looking out for
employment.  Thorhall rode to the ship, saw him and asked if he
would take service with him.  Thorgaut said he would indeed, and
that there would be no difficulties.

"You must be prepared," said Thorhall, "for work which would not
be fitting for a weak-minded person, because of the apparitions
which have been there lately.  I will not deceive you about it."

"I shall not give myself up as lost for the ghostlings," he said.

"Before I am scared some others will not be easy.  I shall not
change my quarters on that account."

The terms were easily arranged and Thorgaut was engaged for the
sheep during the winter.  When the summer had passed away he took
over charge of them, and was on good terms with everybody.  Glam
continued his rides on the roofs.  Thorgaut thought it very
amusing and said the thrall must come nearer if he wished to
frighten him.  Thorhall advised him not to say too much, and said
it would be better if they did not come into conflict.

Thorgaut said: "Surely all the spirit has gone out of you.  I
shall not fall dead in the twilight for stories of that sort."

Yule was approaching.  On the eve the shepherd went out with his
sheep.  The mistress said: "Now I hope that our former
experiences will not be repeated."

"Have no fear for that, mistress," he said.  "There will be
something worth telling of if I come not back."

Then he went out to his sheep.  The weather was rather cold and
there was a heavy snowstorm.  Thorgaut usually returned when it
was getting dark, but this time he did not come.  The people went
to church as usual, but they thought matters looked very much as
they did on the last occasion.  The bondi wanted them to go out
and search for the shepherd, but the churchgoers cried off, and
said they were not going to trust themselves into the power of
trolls in the night; the bondi would not venture out and there
was no search.  On Yule day after their meal they went out to
look for the shepherd, and first went to Glam's cairn, feeling
sure that the shepherd's disappearance must be due to him.  On
approaching the cairn they saw an awful sight; there was the
shepherd, his neck broken, and every bone in his body torn from
its place.  They carried him to the church and no one was
molested by Thorgaut.

Glam became more rampageous than ever.  He was so riotous that at
last everybody fled from Thorhallsstad, excepting the bondi and
his wife.

Thorhall's cowherd had been a long time in his service and he had
become attached to him; for this reason and because he was a
careful herdsman he did not want to part with him.  The man was
very old and thought it would be very troublesome to have to
leave; he saw, too, that everything the bondi possessed would be
ruined if he did not stay to look-after them.  One morning after
midwinter the mistress went to the cow-house to milk the cows as
usual.  It was then full day, for no one would venture out of
doors till then, except the cowherd, who went directly it was
light.  She heard a great crash in the cowhouse and tremendous
bellowing.  She rushed in, shouting that something awful, she
knew not what, was going on in the cowhouse.  The bondi went out
and found the cattle all goring each other.  It seemed not canny
there, so he went into the shed and there saw the cowherd lying
on his back with his head in one stall and his feet in the other.

He went up and felt him, but saw at once that he was dead with
his back broken.  It had been broken over the flat stone which
separated the two stalls.  Evidently it was not safe to remain
any longer on his estate, so he fled with everything that he
could carry away.  All the live-stock which he left behind was
killed by Glam.  After that Glam went right up the valley and
raided every farm as far as Tunga, while Thorhall stayed with his
friends during the rest of the winter.  No one could venture up
the valley with a horse or a dog, for it was killed at once.  As
the spring went on and the sun rose higher in the sky the spook
diminished somewhat, and Thorhall wanted to return to his land,
but found it not easy to get servants.  Nevertheless, he went and
took up his abode at Thorhallsstad.  Directly the autumn set in,
everything began again, and the disturbances increased.  The
person most attacked was the bondi's daughter, who at last died
of it.  Many things were tried but without success.  It seemed
likely that the whole of Vatnsdal would be devastated unless help
could be found.


CHAPTER XXXIV

GRETTIR VISITS HIS UNCLE JOKULL

We have now to return to Grettir, who was at home in Bjarg during
the autumn which followed his meeting with Warrior-Bardi at
Thoreyjargnup.  When the winter was approaching, he rode North
across the neck to Vididal and stayed at Audunarstad.  He and
Audun made friends again; Grettir gave him a valuable battle-axe
and they agreed to hold together in friendship.  Audun had long
lived there, and had many connections.  He had a son named Egill,
who married Ulfheid the daughter of Eyjolf, the son of Gudmund;
their son Eyjolf, who was killed at the All-Thing, was the father
of Orin the chaplain of Bishop Thorlak.

Grettir rode to the North to Vatnsdal and went on a visit to
Tunga, where dwelt his mother's brother, Jokull the son of Bard,
a big strong man and exceedingly haughty.  He was a mariner, very
cantankerous, but a person of much consideration.  He welcomed
Grettir, who stayed three nights with him.  Nothing was talked
about but Glam's walking, and Grettir inquired minutely about all
the particulars.  Jokull told him that no more was said than had
really happened.

"Why, do you want to go there?" he asked.

Grettir said that it was so.  Jokull told him not to do it.

"It would be a most hazardous undertaking," he said.  "Your
kinsmen incur a great risk with you as you are.  There does not
seem to be one of the younger men who is your equal.  It is ill
dealing with such a one as Glam.  Much better fight with human
men than with goblins of that sort."

Grettir said he had a mind to go to Thorhallsstad and see how
things were.  Jokull said: "I see there is no use in dissuading
you.  The saying is true that Luck is one thing, brave deeds
another."

"Woe stands before the door of one but enters that of another,"
answered Grettir.  "I am thinking how it may fare with you
yourself before all is done."

"It may be," said Jokull, "that we both see what is before us,
and yet we may not alter it."

Then they parted, neither of them well pleased with the other's
prophetic saying.


CHAPTER XXXV

THE FIGHT WITH GLAM'S GHOST

Grettir rode to Thorhallsstad where he was welcomed by the bondi.

He asked Grettir whither he was bound, and Grettir said he wished
to spend the night there if the bondi permitted.  Thorhall said
he would indeed be thankful to him for staying there.

"Few," he said, "think it a gain to stay here for any time.  You
must have heard tell of the trouble that is here, and I do not
want you to be inconvenienced on my account.  Even if you escape
unhurt yourself, I know for certain that you will lose your
horse, for no one can keep his beast in safety who comes here."

Grettir said there were plenty more horses to be had if anything
happened to this one.

Thorhall was delighted at Grettir's wishing to remain, and
received him with both hands.  Grettir's horse was placed
securely under lock and key and they both went to bed.  The night
passed without Glam showing himself.

"Your being here has already done some good," said Thorhall. 
"Glam has always been in the habit of riding on the roof or
breaking open the doors every night, as you can see from the
marks."

"Then," Grettir said, "either he will not keep quiet much longer,
or he will remain so more than one night.  I will stay another
night and see what happens."

Then they went to Grettir's horse and found it had not been
touched.  The bondi thought that all pointed to the same thing. 
Grettir stayed a second night and again the thrall did not
appear.  The bondi became hopeful and went to see the horse. 
There he found the stable broken open, the horse dragged outside
and every bone in his body broken.  Thorhall told Grettir what
had occurred and advised him to look to himself, for he was a
dead man if he waited for Glam.

Grettir answered: "I must not have less for my horse than a sight
of the thrall."

The bondi said there was no pleasure to be had from seeing him:
"He is not like any man.  I count every hour a gain that you are
here."

The day passed, and when the hour came for going to bed Grettir
said he would not take off his clothes, and lay down on a seat
opposite to Thorkell's sleeping apartment.  He had a shaggy cloak
covering him with one end of it fastened under his feet and the
other drawn over his head so that he could see through the
neck-hole.  He set his feet against a strong bench which was in
front of him.  The frame-work of the outer door had been all
broken away and some bits of wood had been rigged up roughly in
its place.  The partition which had once divided the hall from
the entrance passage was all broken, both above the cross-beam
and below, and all the bedding had been upset.  The place looked
rather desolate.  There was a light burning in the hall by night.

When about a third part of the night had passed Grettir heard a
loud noise.  Something was going up on to the building, riding
above the hall and kicking with its heels until the timbers
cracked again.  This went on for some time, and then it came down
towards the door.  The door opened and Grettir saw the thrall
stretching in an enormously big and ugly head.  Glam moved slowly
in, and on passing the door stood upright, reaching to the roof. 
He turned to the hall, resting his arms on the cross-beam and
peering along the hall.  The bondi uttered no sound, having heard
quite enough of what had gone on outside.  Grettir lay quite
still and did not move.  Glam saw a heap of something in the
seat, came farther into the hall and seized the cloak tightly
with his hand.  Grettir pressed his foot against the plank and
the cloak held firm.  Glam tugged at it again still more
violently, but it did not give way.  A third time be pulled, this
time with both hands and with such force that he pulled Grettir
up out of the seat, and between them the cloak was torn in two. 
Glam looked at the bit which he held in his hand and wondered
much who could pull like that against him.  Suddenly Grettir
sprang under his arms, seized him round the waist and squeezed
his back with all his might, intending in that way to bring him
down, but the thrall wrenched his arms till he staggered from the
violence.  Then Grettir fell back to another bench.  The benches
flew about and everything was shattered around them.  Glam wanted
to get out, but Grettir tried to prevent him by stemming his foot
against anything he could find.  Nevertheless Glam succeeded in
getting him outside the hall.  Then a terrific struggle began,
the thrall trying to drag him out of the house, and Grettir saw
that however hard he was to deal with in the house, he would be
worse outside, so he strove with all his might to keep him from
getting out.  Then Glam made a desperate effort and gripped
Grettir tightly towards him, forcing him to the porch.  Grettir
saw that he could not put up any resistance, and with a sudden
movement he dashed into the thrall's arms and set both his feet
against a stone which was fastened in the ground at the door. 
For that Glam was not prepared, since he had been tugging to drag
Grettir towards him; he reeled backwards and tumbled bind-
foremost out of the door, tearing away the lintel with his
shoulder and shattering the roof, the rafters and the frozen
thatch.  Head over heels he fell out of the house and Grettir
fell on top of him.  The moon was shining very brightly outside,
with light clouds passing over it and hiding it now and again. 
At the moment when Glam fell the moon shone forth, and Glam
turned his eyes up towards it.  Grettir himself has related that
that sight was the only one which ever made him tremble.  What
with fatigue and all else that he had endured, when he saw the
horrible rolling of Glam's eyes his heart sank so utterly that he
had not strength to draw his sword, but lay there wellnigh
betwixt life and death.  Glam possessed more malignant power than
most fiends, for he now spoke in this wise:

"You have expended much energy, Grettir, in your search for me. 
Nor is that to be wondered at, if you should have little joy
thereof.  And now I tell you that you shall possess only half the
strength and firmness of heart that were decreed to you if you
had not striven with me.  The might which was yours till now I am
not able to take away, but it is in my power to ordain that never
shall you grow stronger than you are now.  Nevertheless your
might is sufficient, as many shall find to their cost.  Hitherto
you have earned fame through your deeds, but henceforward there
shall fall upon you exile and battle; your deeds shall turn to
evil and your guardian-spirit shall forsake you.  You will be
outlawed and your lot shall be to dwell ever alone.  And this I
lay upon you, that these eyes of mine shall be ever before your
vision.  You will find it hard to live alone, and at last it
shall drag you to death."

When the thrall had spoken the faintness which had come over
Grettir left him.  He drew his short sword, cut off Glam's head
and laid it between his thighs.  Then the bondi came out, having
put on his clothes while Glam was speaking, but he did not
venture to come near until he was dead.  Thorhall praised God and
thanked Grettir warmly for having laid this unclean spirit.  Then
they set to work and burned Glam to cold cinders, bound the ashes
in a skin and buried them in a place far away from the haunts of
man or beast.  Then they went home, the day having nearly broken.

Grettir was very stiff and lay down to rest.  Thorhall sent for
some men from the next farms and let them know how things had
fared.  They all realised the importance of Grettir's deed when
they heard of it; all agreed that in the whole country side for
strength and courage and enterprise there was not the equal of
Grettir the son of Asmund.

Thorhall bade a kindly farewell to Grettir and dismissed him with
a present of a fine horse and proper clothes, for all that he had
been wearing were torn to pieces.  They parted in friendship. 
Grettir rode to Ass in Vatnsdal and was welcomed by Thorvald, who
asked him all about his encounter with Glam.  Grettir told him
everything and said that never had his strength been put to trial
as it had been in their long struggle.  Thorvald told him to
conduct himself discreetly; if he did so he might prosper, but
otherwise he would surely come to disaster.  Grettir said that
his temper had not improved, that he had even less discretion
than before, and was more impatient of being crossed.  In one
thing a great change had come over him; he had become so
frightened of the dark that he dared not go anywhere alone at
night.  Apparitions of every kind came before him.  It has since
passed into an expression, and men speak of "Glam's eyes" or
"Glam visions" when things appear otherwise than as they are.

Having accomplished his undertaking Grettir rode back to Bjarg
and spent the winter at home.


CHAPTER XXXVI

THORBJORN SLOWCOACH AT HOME

Thorbjorn Oxmain gave a great feast in the autumn at which many
were assembled, whilst Grettir was in the North in Vatnsdal. 
Thorbjorn Slowcoach was there and many things were talked about. 
The Hrutafjord people inquired about Grettir's adventure on the
ridge in the summer.  Thorbjorn Oxmain praised Grettir's conduct,
and said that Kormak would have had the worst of it if no one had
come to part them.  Then Thorbjorn Slowcoach said: "What I saw
of Grettir's fighting was not famous; and he seemed inclined to
shirk when we came up.  He was very ready to leave off, nor did I
see him make any attempt to avenge the death of Atli's man.  I do
not believe there is much heart in him, except when he has a
sufficient force behind him."

Thorbjorn went on jeering at him in this way.  Many of the others
had something to say about it, and they thought that Grettir
would not leave it to rest if he heard what Thorbjorn was saying.

Nothing more happened at the festivities; they all went home, and
there was a good deal of ill-will between them all that winter,
though no one took any action.  Nothing more happened that
winter.


CHAPTER XXXVII

GRETTIR SAILS FOR NORWAY AND KILLS THORBJORN SLOWCOACH

Early in the spring, before the meeting of the Thing, there
arrived a ship from Norway.  There was much news to tell, above
all of the change of government.  Olaf the son of Harald was now
king, having driven away jarl Sveinn from the country in the
spring which followed the battle of Nesjar.  Many noteworthy
things were told of King Olaf.  Men said that he took into favour
all men who were skilled in any way and made them his followers. 
This pleased many of the younger men in Iceland and made them all
want to leave home.  When Grettir heard of it he longed to go
too, deeming that he merited the king's favour quite as much as
any of the others.  A ship came up to Gasar in Eyjafjord; Grettir
engaged a passage in her and prepared to go abroad.  He had not
much outfit as yet.

Asmund was now becoming very infirm and scarcely left his bed. 
He and Asdis had a young son named Illugi, a youth of much
promise.  Atli had taken over all the management of the farm and
the goods, and things went much better, for he was both obliging
and provident.

Grettir embarked on his ship.  Thorbjorn Slowcoach had arranged
to travel in the same vessel without knowing that Grettir would
be in her.  Some of his friends tried to dissuade him from
travelling in Grettir's company, but he insisted upon going.  He
was rather a long time over his preparations and did not get to
Gasar before the ship was ready to sail.  Before he left home
Asmund Longhair was taken ill and was quite confined to his bed. 
Thorbjorn Slowcoach arrived on the beach late in the day, when
the men were going on board and were washing their hands outside
near their booths.  When he rode up to the rows of booths they
greeted him and asked what news there was.

"I have nothing to tell," he said, "except that the valorous
Asmund at Bjarg is now dead."

Some of them said that a worthy bondi had left the world and
asked how it happened.

"A poor lot befell his Valour," he replied.  "He was suffocated
by the smoke from the hearth, like a dog.  There is no great loss
in him, for he was in his dotage."

"You talk strangely about such a man as he was," they said. 
"Grettir would not be much pleased if he heard you."

"I can endure Grettir's wrath," he said.  "He must bear his axe
higher than he did at Hrutafjardarhals if he wishes to frighten
me."

Grettir heard every word that Thorbjorn said, but took no notice
as long as he was speaking.  When he had finished Grettir said:

"I prophesy, Slowcoach, that you will not die of the smoke from
the hearth, and yet perhaps you will not die of old age either. 
It is strange conduct to say shameful things of innocent men."

Thorbjorn said: "I have nothing to unsay.  I never thought you
would fire up like this on the day when we got you out of the
hands of the men of Mel who were belabouring you like an ox's
head."

Then Grettir spoke a verse:

     "Too long is the tongue of the spanner of bows.
     Full often he suffers the vengeance due.
     Slowcoach!  I tell thee that many a man
     has paid for less shameful speech with his life."

Thorbjorn said his life was neither more nor less in danger than
it was before.

"My prophecies are not generally long-lived," said Grettir, "nor
shall this one be.  Defend yourself if you will; you never will
have better occasion for it than now."

Grettir then struck at him.  He tried to parry the blow with his
arm, but it struck him above the wrist and glanced off on to his
neck so that his head flew off.  The sailors declared it was a
splendid stroke, and that such were the men for the king.  No one
would grieve, they said, because a man so quarrelsome and
scurrilous as Thorbjorn had been killed.

Soon after this they got under way and towards the end of the
summer reached the south coast of Norway, about Hordland, where
they learned that King Olaf was in the North at Thrandheim. 
Grettir took a passage thither with some traders intending to
seek audience of the king.


CHAPTER XXXVIII

GRETTIR FETCHES FIRE -- THE SONS OF THORIR ARE BURNT

There was a man named Thorir dwelling in Gard in Adaldal.  He was
a son of Skeggi Bodolfsson, who had settled in Kelduhverfi, on
lands extending right up to Keldunes, and had married Helga the
daughter of Thorgeir at Fiskilaek.  Thorir was a great chief, and
a mariner.  He had two sons whose names were Thorgeir and Skeggi,
both men of promise, and pretty well grown up at that time. 
Thorir had been in Norway in the summer in which Olaf came East
from England, and had won great favour with the king as well as
with Bishop Sigurd.  In token of this it is related that Thorir
asked the bishop to consecrate a large sea-going ship he had
built in the forest, and the bishop did so.  Later he came out to
Iceland and had his ship broken up because he was tired of
seafaring.  He set up the figures from her head and stem over his
doors, where they long remained foretelling the weather, one
howling for a south, the other for a north wind.

When Thorir heard that Olaf had become sole ruler of Norway he
thought he might expect favour from him, so he dispatched his
sons to Norway to wait upon the king, hoping that they would be
received into his service.  They reached the south coast late in
the autumn and engaged a rowing vessel to take them up the coast
to the North, intending to go to the king.  They reached a port
to the south of Stad, where they put in for a few days.  They
were well provided with food and drink, and did not go out much
because of the bad weather.

Grettir also sailed to the North along the coast, and as the
winter was just beginning he often fell in with dirty weather. 
When they reached the neighbourhood of Stad the weather became
worse, and at last one evening they were so exhausted with the
snow and frost that they were compelled to put in and lie under a
bank where they found shelter for their goods and belongings. 
The men were very much distressed at not being able to procure
any fire; their safety and their lives seemed almost to depend
upon their getting some.  They lay there in a pitiful condition
all the evening, and as night came on they saw a large fire on
the other side of the channel which they were in.  When Grettir's
companions saw the fire they began talking and saying that he who
could get some of it would be a happy man.  They hesitated for
some time whether they should put out, but all agreed that it
would be too dangerous.  Then they had a good deal of talk about
whether there was any man living doughty enough to get the fire. 
Grettir kept very quiet, but said that there probably had been
men who would not have let themselves be baulked.  The men said
that they were none the better for what had been if there were
none now.

"But won't you venture, Grettir?  The people of Iceland all talk
so much about your prowess, and you know very well what we want."

Grettir said: "It does not seem to me such a great thing to get
the fire, but I do not know whether you will reward it any better
than he requires who does it."

"Why," they said, "should you take us to be men of so little
honour that we shall not reward you well?"

"Well," said Grettir, "if you really think it so necessary I will
try it; but my heart tells me that no good will come to me
therefrom."

They said it would not be so, and told him that he should have
their thanks.

Then Grettir threw off his clothes and got ready to go into the
water.  He went in a cloak and breeches of coarse stuff.  He
tucked up the cloak, tied a cord of bast round his waist, and
took a barrel with him.  Then he jumped overboard, swam across
the channel and reached the land on the other side.  There he saw
a house standing and heard sounds of talking and merriment
issuing from it.  So he went towards the house.

We have now to tell of the people who were in the house.  They
were the sons of Thorir who have been mentioned.  They had been
there some days waiting for a change of weather and for a wind to
carry them to the North.  There were twelve of them and they were
all sitting and drinking.  They had made fast in the inner
harbour where there was a place of shelter set up for men who
were travelling about the country, and they had carried in a
quantity of straw.  There was a huge fire on the ground.  Grettir
rushed into the house, not knowing who was there.  His cloak had
all frozen directly he landed, and he was a portentous sight to
behold; he looked like a troll.  The people inside were much
startled, thinking it was a fiend.  They struck at him with
anything they could get, and a tremendous uproar there was. 
Grettir pushed them back with his arms.  Some of them struck at
him with firebrands, and the fire spread all through the house. 
He got away with his fire and returned to his companions, who
were loud in praise of his skill and daring, and said there was
no one like him.  The night passed and they were happy now that
they had fire.

On the next morning the weather was fine.  They all woke early
and made ready to continue their journey.  It was proposed that
they should go and find out who the people were who had had the
fire, so they cast off and sailed across the channel.  They found
no house there, nothing but a heap of ashes and a good many bones
of men amongst them.  Evidently the house with all who were in it
had been burned.  They asked whether Grettir had done it, and
declared it was an abominable deed.  Grettir said that what he
expected had come to pass, and that he was ill rewarded for
getting the fire for them.  He said it was thankless work to help
such miserable beings as they were.  He suffered much annoyance
in consequence, for wherever the traders went they told that
Grettir had burned the men in the house.  Soon it became known
that it was the sons of Thorir of Gard and their followers who
had been burned.  The traders refused to have Grettir on board
their ship any longer and drove him away.  He was so abhorred
that scarcely any one would do him a service.  His case seemed
hopeless, and his only desire was at any cost to appear before
the king.  So he went North to Thrandheim where the king was, and
had heard the whole story before Grettir came, for many had been
busy in slandering him.  Grettir waited several days in the town
before he was able to appear before the king.


CHAPTER XXXIX

GRETTIR APPEARS BEFORE THE KING AND FAILS TO UNDERGO THE ORDEAL

One day when the king was sitting in judgment Grettir came before
him and saluted him respectfully.  The king looked at him and
said:

"Are you Grettir the Strong?"

"So I have been called," he replied, "and I have some here in the
hope of obtaining deliverance from the slanders which are being
spread about me, and to say that I did not do this deed."

The king said: "You are worthy enough; but I know not what
fortune you will have in defending yourself.  It is quite
possible that you did not intend to burn the men in the house."

Grettir said that he was most anxious to prove his innocence if
the king would permit him.  Then the king bade him relate
faithfully all that had happened.  Grettir told him everything
exactly as it was, and declared that they were all alive when he
escaped with his fire; he was ready to undergo any ordeal which
the king considered that the law required.

King Olaf said: "I decree that you shall bear iron, if your fate
so wills it."

Grettir was quite content with that, and began his fast for the
ordeal.  When the day for the ceremony arrived the king and the
bishop went to the church together with a multitude of people who
came out of curiosity to see a man so much talked about as
Grettir.  At last Grettir himself was led to the church.  When he
entered many looked at him and remarked that he excelled most men
in strength and stature.  As he passed down the aisle there
started up a very ill-favoured, overgrown boy and cried to him:

"Wondrous are now the ways in a land where men should call
themselves Christians, when evildoers and robbers and thieves
walk in peace to purge themselves.  What should a wicked man find
better to do than to preserve his life so long as he may?  Here
is now a malefactor convicted of guilt, one who has burnt
innocent men in their houses, and yet is allowed to undergo
purgation.  Such a thing is most unrighteous."

Then he went at Grettir, pointing at him with his finger, making
grimaces and calling him son of a sea-ogress, with many other bad
names.  Then Grettir lost his temper and his self-control.  He
raised his hand and gave him a box on the ear so that he fell
senseless, and some thought he was dead.  No one seemed to know
whence the boy had come nor what became of him afterwards, but it
was generally believed that he was some unclean spirit sent forth
for the destruction of Grettir.

There arose an uproar in the church; people told the king that
the man who had come to purge himself was fighting with those
around him.  King Olaf came forward into the church to see what
was going on, and said:

"You are a man of ill luck, Grettir.  All was prepared for the
ordeal, but it cannot take place now.  It is not possible to
contend against your ill-fortune."

Grettir said: "I expected, oh king, more honour from you for the
sake of my family than I now seem likely to obtain."

Then he told again the story as he had done before of what had
taken place with the men.  "Gladly," he said, "would I enter your
service; there is many a man with you who is not my better as a
warrior."

"I know," said the king, "that few are your equals in strength
and courage, but your luck is too bad for you to remain with me. 
You have my leave to depart in peace whithersoever you will for
the winter, and then in the summer you may return to Iceland,
where you are destined to lay your bones."

"First I should like to clear myself of the charge of burning, if
I may," said Grettir; "for I did not do it intentionally."

"Very likely it is so," said the king; "but since the purgation
has come to naught through your impatience you cannot clear
yourself further than you have done.  Impetuosity always leads to
evil.  If ever a man was doomed to misfortune you are."

After that Grettir remained for a time in the town, but he got
nothing more out of Olaf.  Then he went to the South, intending
after that to go East to Tunsberg to find his brother Thorsteinn
Dromund.  Nothing is told of his journey till he came to Jadar.


CHAPTER XL

ADVENTURE WITH THE BERSERK SNAEKOLL

At Yule Grettir came to a bondi named Einar, a man of wealth who
had a wife and a marriageable daughter named Gyrid.  She was a
beautiful maiden and was considered an excellent match.  Einar
invited Grettir to stay over Yule, and he accepted.

It was no uncommon thing throughout Norway that robbers and other
ruffians came down from the forest and challenged men to fight
for their women, or carried off their property with violence if
there was not sufficient force in the house to protect them.  One
day at Yule-tide there came a whole party of these miscreants to
Einar's house.  Their leader was a great berserk named Snaekoll. 
He challenged Einar to hand over his daughter to him or else to
defend her, if he felt himself man enough to do so.  Now the
bondi was no longer young, and no fighter.  He felt that he was
in a great difficulty, and asked Grettir privately what help he
would give him, seeing that he was held to be so famous a man. 
Grettir advised him to consent only to what was not
dishonourable.  The berserk was sitting on his horse wearing his
helmet, the chin-piece of which was not fastened.  He held before
him a shield bound with iron and looked terribly threatening.  He
said to the bondi:

"You had better choose quickly: either one thing or the other. 
What does that big fellow standing beside you say?  Would he not
like to play with me himself?"

"One of us is as good as the other," said Grettir, "neither of us
is very active."

"All the more afraid will you be to fight with me if I get
angry."

"That will be seen when it is tried," said Grettir.

The berserk thought they were trying to get off by talking.  He
began to howl and to bite the rim of his shield.  He held the
shield up to his mouth and scowled over its upper edge like a
madman.  Grettir stepped quickly across the ground, and when he
got even with the berserk's horse he kicked the shield with his
foot from below with such force that it struck his mouth,
breaking the upper jaw, and the lower jaw fell down on to his
chest.  With the same movement he seized the viking's helmet with
his left hand and dragged him from his horse, while with
his right hand he raised his axe and cut off the berserk's head. 
Snaekoll's followers when they saw what had happened fled, every
man of them.  Grettir did not care to pursue them for he saw that
there was no heart in them.  The bondi thanked him for what he
had done, as did many other men, for the quickness and boldness
of his deed had impressed them much.  Grettir stayed there for
Yule and was well taken care of till he left, when the bondi
dismissed him handsomely.  Then Grettir went East to Tunsberg to
visit his brother Thorsteinn, who received him joyfully and asked
him about his adventures.  Grettir told him how he had killed the
berserk, and composed a verse :

     "The warrior's shield by my foot propelled
     in conflict came with Snaekoll's mouth.
     His nether jaw hung down on his chest,
     wide gaped his mouth from the iron ring."

"You would be very handy at many things," said Thorsteinn, "if
misfortune did not follow you."

"Men will tell of deeds that are done," said Grettir.


CHAPTER XLI

THORSTEINN DROMUND'S ARMS

Grettir stayed with Thorsteinn for the rest of the winter and on
into the spring.  One morning when Thorsteinn and Grettir were
above in their sleepingroom Grettir put out his arm from the
bed-clothes and Thorsteinn noticed it when he awoke.  Soon after
Grettir woke too, and Thorsteinn said: "I have been looking at
your arms, kinsman, and think it is not wonderful that your blows
fall heavily upon some.  Never have I seen any man's arms that
were like yours."

"You may know," said Grettir, "that I should not have done the
deeds I have if I had not been very mighty."

"Yet methinks it would be of advantage," said Thorsteinn, "if
your arm were more slender and your fortune better."

"True," said Grettir, "is the saying that no man shapes his own
fortune.  Let me see your arm."

Thorsteinn showed it to him.  He was a tall lanky man.  Grettir
smiled and said:

"There is no need to look long at that; all your ribs are run
together.  I never saw such a pair of tongs as you carry about! 
Why, you are scarcely as strong as a woman!"

"It may be so," said Thorsteinn, "and yet you may know that these
thin arms of mine and no others will avenge you some day; -- if
you are avenged."

"Who shall know how it will be when the end comes?" said Grettir;
"but that seems unlikely."

No more is related of their conversation.  The spring came and
Grettir took a ship for Iceland in the summer.  The brothers
parted with friendship and never saw one another again.


CHAPTER XLII

DEATH OF ASMUND LONGHAIR

We have now to return to where we broke off before.  Thorbjorn
Oxmain when he heard of the death of Thorbjorn Slowcoach flew
into a violent passion and said he wished that more men might
deal blows in other people's houses.  Asmund Longhair lay sick
for some time in the summer.  When he thought his end was nigh he
called his kinsmen round him and said his will was that Atli
should take over all the property after his day.  "I fear," he
said, "that the wicked will scarce leave you in peace.  And I
wish all my kinsmen to support him to the best of their power. 
Of Grettir I can say nothing, for his condition seems to me like
a rolling wheel.  Strong though he is, I fear he will have more
dealing with trouble than with kinsmen's support.  And Illugi,
though young now, shall become a man of valiant deeds if he
remain unscathed."

When Asmund had settled everything with his sons according to his
wish his sickness grew upon him.  He died soon after and was
buried at Bjarg, where he had had a church built.  All felt his
loss deeply.

Atli became a great bondi and kept a large establishment.  He was
a great dealer in household provisions.  Towards the end of the
summer he went to Snaefellsnes to get dried fish.  He drove
several horses with him and rode from home to Melar in Hrutafjord
to his brother-in-law, Gamli.  Then Grim, the son of Thorhall,
Gamli's brother, made ready to accompany him along with another
man.  They rode West by way of Haukadalsskard and the road which
leads out to the Ness, where they bought much fish and carried it
away-on seven horses; when all was ready they turned homewards.


CHAPTER XLIII

THE SONS OF THORIR OF SKARD ARE SLAIN BY ATLI AND GRIM

Thorbjorn Oxmain heard of Atli and Grim having left home just
when Gunnar and Thorgeir, the sons of Thorir of Skard, were with
him.  Thorbjorn was jealous of Atli's popularity and egged on the
two brothers, the sons of Thorir, to lie in wait for him as he
returned from Snaefellsnes.  They rode home to Skard and waited
there for Atli returning with his loads.  They could see the
party from their house as they passed Skard, and made ready
quickly to pursue them with their servants.  Atli on seeing them
ordered his horses to be unloaded.

"Perhaps," he said, "they want to offer me compensation for my
man whom Gunnar slew last summer.  We will not be the first to
attack, but if they begin fighting us we will defend ourselves."

Then they came up and at once sprang off their horses.  Atli
greeted them and asked what news there was, and whether Gunnar
desired to offer him some compensation for his servant.  Gunnar
answered:

"You men of Bjarg, you deserve something else than that I should
pay compensation for him with my goods.  Thorbjorn whom Grettir
slew is worth a higher atonement than he."

"I have not to answer for that," said Atli, "nor are you the
representative of Thorbjorn."

Gunnar said it would have to be so nevertheless.  "And now," he
cried, "let us go for them and profit by Grettir being away."

There were eight of them, and they set upon Atli's six.  Atli led
on his men and drew the sword Jokulsnaut which Grettir had given
him.  Thorgeir cried: "Good men are alike in many things.  High
did Grettir bear his sword last summer on Hrutafjardarhals."

Atli answered: "He is more accustomed to deeds of strength than I
am."

Then they fought.  Gunnar made a resolute attack on Atli, and
fought fiercely.  After they had battled for a time Atli said:

"There is nothing to be gained by each of us killing the other's
followers.  The simplest course would be for us to play together,
for I have never fought with weapons before."

Gunnar, however, would not have it.  Atli bade his servants look
to the packs, and he would see what the others would do.  He made
such a vigorous onslaught that Gunnar's men fell back, and he
killed two of them.  Then he turned upon Gunnar himself and
struck a blow that severed his shield right across below the
handle, and the sword struck his leg below the knee.  Then with
another rapid blow he killed him.

In the meantime Grim, the son of Thorhall, was engaging Thorgeir,
and a long tussle there was, both of them being men of great
valour.  When Thorgeir saw his brother Gunnar fall he wanted to
get away, but Grim pressed upon him and pursued him until at last
his foot tripped and he fell forward.  Then Grim struck him with
an axe between the shoulders, inflicting a deep wound.  To the
three followers who were left they gave quarter.  Then they bound
up their wounds, reloaded the packs on to the horses and went
home, giving information of the battle.  Atli stayed at home with
a strong guard of men that autumn.  Thorbjorn Oxmain was not at
all pleased, but could do nothing, because Atli was very wary. 
Grim was with him for the winter, and his brother-in-law Gamli. 
Another brother-in-law, Glum the son of Ospak from Eyr in Bitra,
was with them too.  They had a goodly array of men settled at
Bjarg, and there was much merriment there during the winter.


CHAPTER XLIV

SETTLEMENT OF THE FEUD AT THE HUNAVATN THING

Thorbfron Oxmain took up the suit arising from the death of
Thorir's sons.  He prepared his case against Grim and Atli, and
they prepared their defence on the grounds that the brothers had
attacked them wrongfully and were, therefore, "ohelgir."  The
case was brought before the Hunavatn Thing and both sides
appeared in force.  Atli had many connections , and was,
therefore, strongly supported.  Then those who were friends of
both came forward and tried to effect a reconciliation; they
urged that Atli was a man of good position and peacefully
disposed, though fearless enough when driven into a strait. 
Thorbjorn felt that no other honourable course was open to him
but to agree to a reconciliation.  Atli made it a condition that
there should be no sentence of banishment either from the
district or the country.  Then men were appointed to arbitrate:
Thorvald Asgeirsson on behalf of Atli, and Solvi the Proud on
behalf of Tborbjorn.  This Solvi was a son of Asbrand, the son of
Thorbrand, the son of Harald Ring who had settled in Vatnsnes,
taking land as far as Ambattara to the West, and to the East up
to the Thvera and across to Bjargaoss and the whole side of
Bjorg as far as the sea.  Solvi was a person of much display, but
a man of sense, and therefore Thorbjorn chose him as his
arbitrator.

The decree of the arbitrators was that half penalties should be
paid for Thorir's sons and half should be remitted on account of
the wrongful attack which they made and their designs on Atli's
life.  The slaying of Atli's man at Hrutafjardarhals should be
set off against the two of theirs who had been killed.  Grim the
son of Thorhall was banished from his district and the penalties
were to be paid by Atli.  Atli was satisfied with this award, but
Thorbjorn was not; they parted nominally reconciled, but
Thorbjorn let drop some words to the effect that it was not over
yet if all happened as he desired.

Atli rode home from the Thing after thanking Thorvald for his
assistance.  Grim the son of Thorhall betook himself to the South
to Borgarfjord and dwelt at Gilsbakki, where he was known as a
worthy bondi.


CHAPTER XLV

ATLI MURDERED BY THORBJORN OXMAIN

There was dwelling with Thorbjorn Oxmain a man whose name was
Ali, a servant, rather stubborn and lazy.  Thorbjorn told him he
must work better or he would be beaten.  Ali said he had no mind
for work and became abusive.  Thorbjorn was not going to endure
that, and got him down and handled him roughly.  After that Ali
ran away and went to the North across the neck to Midfjord; he
did not stop till he reached Bjarg.  Atli was at home and asked
whither he was going.  He said he was seeking an engagement.

"Are you not a servant of Thorbjorn?" Atli asked.

"We did not get on with our bargain.  I was not there long, but
it seemed to me a bad place while I was there.  Our parting was
in such a way that his song on my throat did not please me.  I
will never go back there, whatever becomes of me.  And it is true
that there is a great difference between you two in the way you
treat your servants.  I would be glad to take service with you if
there is a place, for me."

Atli said: "I have servants enough without stretching forth my
hands for those whom Thorbjorn has hired.  You seem an impatient
man and had better go back to him."

"I am not going there of my own free will," said Ali.

He stayed there for the night, and in the morning went out to
work with Atli's men, and toiled as if he had hands everywhere. 
So he continued all the summer; Atli took no notice of him, but
allowed him his food, for he was pleased with the man's work. 
Soon Thorbjorn learned that Ali was at Bjarg.  He rode thither
with two others and called to Atli to come out and speak with
him.  Atli went out and greeted him.

"You want to begin again provoking me to attack you, Atli," he
said.  "Why have you taken away my workman?  It is a most
improper thing to do."

Atli replied: "It is not very clear to me that he is your
workman.  I do not want to keep him if you can prove that he
belongs to your household; but I cannot drive him out of my
house."

"You must have your way now," said Thorbjorn; "but I claim the
man and protest against his working for you.  I shall come again,
and it is not certain that we shall then part any better friends
than we are now."

Atli rejoined: "I shall stay at home and abide whatever comes to
hand."

Thorbjorn then went off home.  When the workmen came back in the
evening Atli told them of his conversation with Thorbjorn and
said to Ali that he must go his own ways, for he was not going to
be drawn into a quarrel for employing him.

Ali said: "True is the ancient saying:  The over-praised are the
worst deceivers.  I did not think that you would have turned me
off now after I had worked here till I broke in the summer.  I
thought that you would have given me protection.  Such is your
way, however you play the beneficent.  Now I shall be beaten
before your very eyes if you refuse to stand by me."

Atli's mind was changed after the man had spoken; he no longer
wanted to drive him away.

So the time passed until the hay-harvest began.  One day a little
before midsummer Thorbjorn Oxmain rode to Bjarg.  He wore a
helmet on his head, a sword was girt at his side, and in his hand
was a spear which had a very broad blade.  The weather was rainy;
Atli had sent his men to mow the hay, and some were in the North
at Horn on some work.  Atli was at home with a few men only. 
Thorbjorn arrived alone towards midday and rode up to the door. 
The door was shut and no one outside.  Thorbjorn knocked at the
door and then went to the back of the house so that he could not
be seen from the door.  The people in the house heard some one
knocking and one of the women went out.  Thorbjorn got a glimpse
of the woman, but did not let himself be seen, for he was seeking
another person.  She went back into the room and Atli asked her
who had come.  She said she could see nobody outside.  As they
were speaking Thorbjorn struck a violent blow on the door.  Atli
said:

"He wants to see me; perhaps he has some business with me, for
he seems very pressing."

Then he went to the outer door and saw nobody there.  It was
raining hard, so he did not go outside, but stood holding both
the door-posts with his hands and peering round.  At that moment
Thorbjorn sidled round to the front of the door and thrust his
spear with both hands into Atli's middle, so that it pierced him
through.  Atli said when he received the thrust: "They use broad
spear-blades nowadays."

Then he fell forward on the threshold.  The women who were inside
came out and saw that he was dead.  Thorbjorn had then mounted
his horse; he proclaimed the slaying and rode home.  Asdis, the
mistress of the house, sent for men; Atli's body was laid out and
he was buried beside his father.  There was much lamentation over
his death, for he was both wise and beloved.  No blood-money was
paid for his death, nor was any demanded, for his representative
was Grettir, if he should ever return to Iceland.  The matter
rested there during the summer.  Thorbjorn gained little credit
by this deed, but remained quietly at home.


CHAPTER XLVI

SENTENCE OF OUTLAWRY PASSED UPON GRETTIR AT THE ALL-THING

In that same summer before the assembly of the Thing there came a
ship out to Gasar bringing news of Grettir and of his house-
burning adventure.  Thorir of Gard was very angry when he
heard of it and bethought himself of vengeance for his sons upon
Grettir.  Thorir rode with a large retinue to the Thing and laid
a complaint in respect of the burning, but men thought nothing
could be done as long as there was no one to answer the charge. 
Thorir insisted that he would be content with nothing short of
banishment for Grettir from the whole country after such a crime.

Then Skapti the Lawman said: "It certainly was an evil deed if
all really happened as has been told.  But One man's tale is but
half a tale.  Most people try and manage not to improve a story
if there is more than one version of it.  I hold that no judgment
should be passed for Grettir's banishment without further
proceedings."

Thorir was a notable person and possessed great influence in the
district; many powerful men were his friends.  He pressed his
suit so strongly that nothing could be done to save Grettir. 
Thorir had him proclaimed an outlaw throughout the country, and
was ever afterwards the most bitter of his opponents, as he often
found.  Having put a price upon his head, as it was usual to do
with other outlaws, he rode home.  Many said that the decree was
carried more by violence than by law, but it remained in force. 
Nothing more happened until after midsummer.


CHAPTER XLVII

GRETTIR RETURNS TO BJARG -- SVEINN AND HIS HORSE SADDLE-HEAD

Later in the summer Grettir the son of Asmund came back to
Iceland, landing in the Hvita in Borgarfjord.  People about the
district went down to the ship and all the news came at once upon
Grettir, first that his father was dead, then that his brother
was slain, and third that he was declared outlaw throughout the
land.  Then he spoke this verse:

     "All fell at once upon the bard,
     exile, father dead and brother.
     Oh man of battle!  Many an one
     who breaks the swords shall smart for this."

It is told that Grettir changed his manner no whit for these
tidings, but was just as merry as before.  He remained on board
his ship for a time because he could not get a horse to suit him.

There was a man named Sveinn who dwelt at Bakki up from Thingnes.

He was a good bondi and a merry companion; he often composed
verses which it was a delight to listen to.  He had a brown mare,
the swiftest of horses, which he called Saddle-head.  Once
Grettir left Vellir in the night because he did not wish the
traders to know of it.  He got a black cape and put it over his
clothes to conceal himself.  He went up past Thingnes to Bakki,
by which time it was light.  Seeing a brown horse in the meadow
he went up and put a bridle on it, mounted on its back and rode
up along the Hvita river below Baer on to the river Flokadalsa
and up to the road above Kalfanes.  The men working at Bakki were
up by then, and told the bondi that a man was riding his horse. 
He got up and laughed and spoke a verse:

     "There rode a man upon Saddle-head's back;
     close to the garth the thief has come.
     Frey of the Odin's cloud, dreadful of aspect,
     appears from his strength to be busy with mischief."

Then he took a horse and rode after him.  Grettir rode on till he
came to the settlement at Kropp, where he met a man named Halli
who said he was going down to the ship at Vellir.  Grettir then
spoke a verse:

     "Tell, oh tell in the dwellings abroad
     tell thou hast met with Saddle-head.
     The handler of dice in sable cowl
     sat on his back; hasten, oh Halli!"

Then they parted.  Halli went along the road as far as Kalfanes
before he met Sveinn.  They greeted each other hurriedly and
Sveinn said:

     "Saw you that loafer ride from the dwellings?
     Sorely he means my patience to try.
     The people about shall deal with him roughly;
     blue shall his body be if I meet him."

"You can know from what I tell you," said Halli, "that I met the
man who said he was riding Saddle-head, and he told me to spread
it abroad in the dwellings and the district.  He was a huge man
in a black cloak."

"Well, he seems to think something of himself," said the bondi. 
"I mean to know who he is."

Then he went on after him.  Grettir came to Deildartunga and
found a woman outside.  He began to talk to her and spoke a
verse:

     "Mistress august!  Go tell of the jest
     that the serpent of earth has past on his way.
     The garrulous brewer of Odin's mead
     will come to Gilsbakki before he will rest."

The woman learned the verse and Grettir rode on.  Soon after
Sveinn rode up; she was still outside, and when he came he spoke
the verse:

     "Who was the man who a moment ago
     rode past on a dusky horse in the storm?
     The hound-eyed rascal, practised in mischief.
     This day I will follow his steps to the end."

She told him as she had been taught.  He considered the lines and
said: "It is not unlikely that this man is no play-fellow for me.

But I mean to catch him."

He then rode along the cultivated country.  Each could see the
other's path.  The weather was stormy and wet.  Grettir reached
Gilsbakki that day, where Grim the son of Thorhall welcomed him
warmly and begged him to stay, which he did.  He let Saddle-head
run loose and told Grim how he had come by her.  Then Sveinn came
up, dismounted and saw his horse.  Then he said:

     "Who has ridden on my mare?
     Who will pay me for her hire?
     Who ever saw such an arrant thief?
     What next will be the cowl-man's game?"

Grettir had then put off his wet clothes, and heard the ditty. 
He said:

     "Home I rode the mare to Grim's,
     a better man than the hovel-dweller!
     Nothing will I pay for hire!
     Now we may be friends again."

"Just so shall it be," said the bondi.  "Your ride on the horse
is fully paid for."

Then they each began repeating verses, and Grettir said he could
not blame him for looking after his property.  The bondi stayed
there the night and they had great jokes about the matter.  The
verses they made were called "Saddle-head verses."  In the
morning the bondi rode home, parting good friends with Grettir. 
Grim told Grettir of many things that had been done in Midfjord
in the North during his absence, and that no blood-money had been
paid for Atli.  Thorbjorn Oxmain's interest, he said, was so
great that there was no certainty of Grettir's mother, Asdis,
being allowed to remain at Bjarg if the feud continued.

Grettir stayed but a few nights with Grim, for he did not want it
to become known that he was about to travel North across the
Heath.  Grim told him to come back to visit him if he needed
protection.  "Yet," he said, "I would gladly avoid the penalty of
being outlawed for harbouring you."

Grettir bade him farewell and said: "It is more likely that I
shall need your good services still more later on."

Then Grettir rode North over the Tvidaegra Heath to Bjarg, where
he arrived at midnight.  All were asleep except his mother.  He
went to the back of the house and entered by a door which was
there, for he knew all the ways about.  He entered the hall and
went to his mother's bed, groping his way.  She asked who was
there.  Grettir told her.  She sat up and turned to him, heaving
a weary sigh as she spoke:

"Welcome, my kinsman!  My hoard of sons has quickly passed away. 
He is killed who was most needful to me; you have been declared
an outlaw and a criminal; my third is so young that he can do
nothing."

"It is an ancient saying," said Grettir, "that one evil is mended
by a worse one.  There is more in the heart of man than money can
buy; Atli may yet be avenged.  As for me, there will be some who
think they have had enough in their dealings with me."

She said that was not unlikely.  Grettir stayed there for a time,
but few knew of it, and he obtained news of the movements of the
men of the district.  It was not known then that he had come to
Midfjord.  He learned that Thorbjorn Oxmain was at home with few
men.  This was after the hay-harvest.


CHAPTER XLVIII

DEATH OF THORBJORN OXMAIN

One fine day Grettir rode to the West across the ridge to
Thoroddsstad, where he arrived about noon and knocked at the
door.  Some women came out and greeted him, not knowing who he
was.  He asked for Thorbjorn, and they told him that he was gone
out into the fields to bind hay with his sixteen-year-old son
Arnor.  Thorbjorn was a hard worker and was scarcely ever idle. 
Grettir on hearing that bade them farewell and rode off North on
the road to Reykir.  There is some marsh-land stretching away
from the ridge with much grass-land, where Thorbjorn had made a
quantity of hay which was just dry.  He was just about to bind it
up for bringing in with the help of his son, while a woman
gathered up what was left.  Grettir rode to the field from below,
Thorbjorn and his son being above him; they had finished one load
and were beginning a second.  Thorbjorn had laid down his shield
and sword against the load, and his son had his hand-axe near
him.

Thorbjorn saw a man coming and said to his son: "There is a
man riding towards us; we had better stop binding the hay and see
what he wants."

They did so; Grettir got off his horse.  He had a helmet on his
head, a short sword by his side, and a great spear in his hand
without barbs and inlaid with silver at the socket.  He sat down
and knocked out the rivet which fastened the head in order to
prevent Thorbjorn from returning the spear upon him.

Thorbjorn said: "This is a big man.  I am no good at judging men
if that is not Grettir the son of Asmund.  No doubt be thinks
that he has sufficient business with us.  We will meet him boldly
and show him no signs of fear.  We must act with a plan.  I will
go on ahead towards him and see how we get on together, for I
will trust myself against any man if I can meet him alone.  Do
you go round and get behind him; take your axe with both hands
and strike him between the shoulders.  You need not fear that he
will hurt you, for his back will be turned towards you."

Neither of them had a helmet.  Grettir went along the marsh and
when he was within range launched his spear at Thorbjorn.  The
head was not so firm as he had intended it to be, so it got loose
in its flight and fell off on to the ground.  Thorbjorn took his
shield, held it before him, drew his sword and turned against
Grettir directly he recognised him.  Grettir drew his sword, and,
turning round a little, saw the boy behind him; so he kept
continually on the move.  When he saw that the boy was within
reach he raised his sword aloft and struck Arnor's head with the
back of it such a blow that the skull broke and he died.  Then
Thorbjorn rushed upon Grettir and struck at him, but he parried
it with the buckler in his left hand and struck with his sword a
blow which severed Thorbjorn's shield in two and went into his
head, reaching the brain.  Thorbjorn fell dead.  Grettir gave him
no more wounds; he searched for the spear-head but could not find
it.  He got on to his horse, rode to Reykir and proclaimed the
slaying.

The woman who was out in the field with them witnessed the
battle.  She ran home terrified and told the news that Thorbjorn
and his son were killed.  The people at home were much taken
aback, for no one was aware of Grettir's arrival.  They sent to
the next homestead for men, who came in plenty and carried the
body to the church.  The bloodfeud then fell to Thorodd
Drapustuf, who at once called out his men.

Grettir rode home to Bjarg and told his mother what had happened.

She was very glad and said he had now shown his kinship to the
Vatnsdal race.  "And yet," she said, "this is the root and the
beginning of your outlawry; for certain I know that your dwelling
here will not be for long by reason of Thorbjorn's kinsmen, and
now they may know that they have the means of annoying you."

Grettir then spoke a verse:

     "Atli's death was unatoned;
     fully now the debt is paid."

Asdis said it was true: "but I know not what counsel you now mean
to take."

Grettir said he meant now to visit his friends and kinsmen in the
western regions, and that she should have no unpleasantness on
his account.  Then he made ready to go, and parted with much
affection from his mother.  First he went to Melar in Hrutafjord
and recounted to his brother-in-law Gamli all his adventure with
Thorbjorn.  Gamli begged him to betake himself away from
Hrutafjord while the kinsmen of Thorbjorn were abroad with their
men, and said they would support him in the suit about Atli's
slaying to the best of their power.  Then Grettir rode to the
West across the Laxardal Heath and did not stop before he reached
Ljarskogar, where he stayed some time in the autumn with
Thorsteinn Kuggason.


CHAPTER XLIX

GRETTIR VISITS THORSTEINN KUGGASON AND SNORRI GODI

Thorodd Drapustuf now made inquiries who it was who had killed
Thorbjorn and his son.  They went to Reykir, where they were told
that Grettir had proclaimed the slaying.  Thorodd then saw how
matters stood and went to Bjarg, where he found many people and
asked whether Grettir was there.  Asdis said that he was gone,
and that he would not hide if he were at home.

"You can be well content to leave things as they are.  The
vengeance for Atli was not excessive, if it be reckoned up.  No
one asked what I had to suffer then, and now it were well for it
to rest."

Then they rode home, and it seemed as if there were nothing to be
done.  The spear which Grettir had lost was never found until
within the memory of men now living.  It was found in the later
days of Sturla the Lawman, the son of Thord, in the very marsh
where Thorbjorn fell, now called Spearmarsh.  This is the proof
that he was killed there and not in Midfitjar, as has been
elsewhere asserted.

Thorbjorn's kinsmen learned of Grettir's being in Ljarskogar and
called together their men with the purpose of going there.  Gamli
heard of this at Melar and sent word to Thorsteinn and Grettir of
their approach.  Thorsteinn sent Grettir on to Tunga to Snorri
the Godi, with whom he was then at peace, and advised Grettir to
ask for his protection, and if it were refused to go West to
Thorgils the son of Ari in Reykjaholar, "who will surely take you
in for the winter.  Stay there in the Western fjords until the
affair is settled."

Grettir said he would follow his counsel.  He rode to Tunga where
he found Snorri and asked to be taken in.  Snorri answered: "I am
now an old man, and have no mind to harbour outlaws, unless in a
case of necessity.  But what has happened that the old man should
have turned you out?"

Grettir said that Thorsteinn had often shown him kindness; "but
we shall need more than him alone to do any good."

Snorri said: "I will put in my word on your behalf, if it will be
of any use to you.  But you must seek your quarters elsewhere
than with me."

So they parted.  Grettir then went West to Reykjanes.  The men of
Hrutafjord came with their followers to Samsstad, where they
heard that Grettir had left Ljarskogar, and went back home.


CHAPTER L

GRETTIR WINTERS WITH THORGILS AT REYKJAHOLAR IN COMPANY WITH THE
FOSTER-BROTHERS

Grettir came to Reykjaholar towards the beginning of the winter
and asked Thorgils to let him stay the winter with him.  Thorgils
said he was welcome to his entertainment, like other free men;
"but," he said, "we do not pay much attention to the preparation
of the food."

Grettir said that would not trouble him.

"There is another little difficulty," Thorgils continued.  "Some
men are expected here who are a little hot-headed, namely, the
foster-brothers Thorgeir and Thormod.  I do not know how it will
suit you to be together with them.  They shall always have
entertainment here whenever they wish for it.  You may stay here
if you will, but I will not have any of you behaving ill to the
others."

Grettir said that he would not be the first to raise a quarrel
with any man, more especially since the bondi had expressed his
wish to him.

Soon after the foster-brothers came up.  Thorgeir and Grettir did
not take very kindly to one another, but Thormod behaved with
propriety.  Thorgils said to them what he had said to Grettir,
and so great was the deference paid to him that none of them
spoke an improper word to the other, although they did not always
think alike.  In this way the first part of the winter was
passed.

Men say that the islands called Olafseyjar, lying in the fjord
about a mile and a half from Reykjanes, belonged to Thorgils.  He
had there a valuable ox, which he had not brought away in the
autumn.  He was always saying that he wanted him to be brought in
before Yule.  One day the foster-brothers prepared to go and
fetch the ox, but wanted a third man to help them.  Grettir
offered to go with them and they were very glad to have him.  So
the three set out in a ten-oared boat.  The weather was cold and
the wind from the North; the boat was lying at Hvalshausholm. 
When they left the wind had freshened a little; they reached the
island and caught the ox.  Grettir asked whether they preferred
to ship the ox or to hold the boat, for there was a high surf
running on the shore.  They told him to hold the boat.  He stood
by her middle on the side away from the land, the sea reaching
right up to beneath his shoulders, but he held the boat firmly so
that she could not drift.  Thorgeir took the ox by the stern and
Thormod by the head, and so they hove him into the boat.  Then
they started heading for the bay, Thormod taking the bow-oars
with Thorgeir amidships and Grettir in the stern.  By the time
they reached Hafraklett the wind was very high.  Thorgeir said:
"The stern is slackening."

Grettir said: "The stem will not be left behind if the rowing
amidships is all right."

Thorgeir then bent his back to the oars and pulled so violently
that both the rowlocks carried away.  He said:

"Pull on, Grettir, whilst I mend the rowlocks."

Grettir pulled vigorously whilst Thorgeir mended the rowlocks. 
But when Thorgeir was about to take over the oars again they were
so damaged that on Grettir giving them a shake on the gunwale
they broke.  Thormod said it would be better to row less and not
to break the ship.  Then Grettir took two spars which were on
board, bored two holes in the gunwale, and rowed so energetically
that every timber creaked.  As the boat was well found and the
men in good condition they reached Hvalshausholm.  Grettir asked
whether they would go on home with the ox or whether they would
beach the boat.  They preferred to beach the boat, and they did
so with all the water that was in her all frozen.  Grettir got
off the ox, which was very stiff in its limbs and very fat and
tired; when they got to Titlingsstad it could go no more.  The
foster-brothers went home, for none of them would help the other
at his job.  Thorgils asked after Grettir; they told him how they
had parted, and he sent men out to him.  When they came below
Hellisholar they saw a man coming towards them with an ox on his
back; it was Grettir carrying the ox.  They all admired his great
feat, but Thorgeir became rather jealous of Grettir's strength.

One day soon after Yule Grettir went out alone to bathe. 
Thorgeir knew of it and said to Thormod: "Let us go out now and
see what Grettir does if I attack him as he comes out of the
water"

"I don't care to do that," Thormod said; "and I do not think you
will get any good from him."

"I mean to go," Thorgeir said.

He went down to the bank, carrying his axe aloft.  Grettir was
just coming out of the water, and when they met Thorgeir said:
"Is it true, Grettir, that you once said you would not run away
from any single person."

"I don't know whether I did," Grettir said; "but I have scarcely
run away from you."

Thorgeir raised his axe.  In a moment Grettir ran at him and
brought him over with a heavy fall.  Thorgeir said to Thormod:
"Are you going to stand there while this devil knocks me down?"

Thormod then got Grettir by the leg and tried to drag him off
Thorgeir but could not.  He was wearing a short sword, and was
just about to draw it when Thorgils came up and told them to
behave themselves and not to fight with Grettir.  They did as he
bade and made out that it was all play.  They had no more strife,
so far as has been told, and men thought Thorgils blessed by
fortune in having been able to pacify men of such violent
tempers.

When the spring set in they all departed.  Grettir went on to
Thorskafjord.  When some one asked him how he liked his
entertainment at Reykjaholar he answered: "Our fare was such that
I enjoyed my food very much -- when I could get it."  Then he
went West over the heath.


CHAPTER LI

GRETTIR'S CASE OVERBORNE AT THE ALL-THING

Thorgils, the son of Ari, rode to the Thing with a large
following.  All the magnates were there from all parts of the
country, and he soon met with Skapti the Lawman and had some talk
with him.  Skapti said:

"Is it true, Thorgils, that you have been giving winter
entertainment to three of the most unruly men in the country, all
three of them outlaws, and that you kept order so well that none
of them did any harm to the other?"

Thorgils said it was true.

Skapti said: "Well, I think it shows what authority you possess. 
But how did their characters appear to you?  Who is the most
valorous among them?"

"They are all entirely valiant," he answered, "but of two of them
I will not say that they never fear; only there is a difference. 
Thormod fears God, and is a man of great piety; and Grettir fears
the dark.  He will not, if he may follow his own inclination,
venture anywhere after nightfall.  But Thorgeir, my kinsman, he I
think cannot fear."

"They must be each of them as you say," said Skapti, and there
their conversation ended.

At the Thing Thorodd Drapustuf laid his complaint in the matter
of the slaying of Thorbjorn Oxmain, for he had failed in the
Hunavatn Thing through the influence of Atli's kinsmen.  Here he
thought that there was less likelihood of his case being
overborne.  Atli's party sought counsel of Skapti the Lawman; he
said that their defence appeared to him a good one, and that full
blood-money would have to be paid for Atli.  Then the case was
brought before the judges, and the opinion of the majority was
that the slaying of Atli was set off by that of Thorbjorn. 
Skapti when he heard of it went to the judges and asked them on
what grounds their decision rested; they said that the two slain
bondis were of equal rank.

Skapti asked: "Which happened first, the outlawing of Grettir or
the death of Atli?"

"They reckoned up and found that a week had elapsed between the
two events.  Grettir was outlawed at the All-Tliing and Atli was
killed just after it.

"That was what I expected," Skapti said.  "You have overlooked
the facts; you have treated as a party to the suit a man who was
an outlaw, a man who was stopped from appearing either as
plaintiff or defendant.  I maintain that Grettir has no standing
in the case, and that it must be brought by the kinsmen of the
deceased who are nearest at law."

Thorodd Drapustuf said: "Who then is to answer for the slaying of
my brother Thorbjorn?"

"See to that yourself," said Skapti.  "Grettir's kinsmen are not
liable to pay for his deeds unless his sentence be removed."

When Thorvald the son of Asgeir learned of Grettir's status in
court having been disallowed, inquiry was made for Atli's nearest
of kin, and these were found to be Skeggi the son of Gamli at
Melar and Ospak the son of Glum of Eyr in Bitra.  Both were
valiant and strenuous men.  Thorodd was then mulcted in blood-
money for the slaying of Atli and had to pay two hundreds of
silver.

Then Snorri the Godi spoke:

"Men of Hrutafjord!  Are you willing now to agree to the
remission of the fine in consideration of Grettir's sentence
being commuted?  I expect that as an outlaw he will bite you
sorely."

Grettir's kinsmen welcomed this proposal, and said they did not
care about the money if Grettir could have peace and freedom. 
Thorodd said he saw that his case was beset with difficulties,
and that for his part he was willing to accept the proposal. 
Snorri said that inquiry must first be made whether Thorir of
Gard would agree to Grettir being freed.  When Thorir heard of it
he was furious, and said that never should Grettir either go or
come out of his outlawry.  So far from consenting to his being
amnestied, he would put a higher price upon his head than was put
upon any other outlaw.

When they knew that he would take it so ill, nothing more was
said about the amnesty.  Ospak and Skeggi took the money that was
paid and kept it, while Thorodd Drapustuf got no compensation for
his brother Thorbjorn.  He and Thorir each offered a reward of
three marks of silver for Grettir's head; this seemed to men to
be an innovation, for never before had more than three marks in
all been offered.  Snorri said it was very unwise to make such
efforts to keep a man outlawed who could do so much mischief, and
that many would suffer for it.  Then they parted and men rode
home from the Thing.


CHAPTER LII

GRETTIR IS CAPTURED BY FARMERS AND RELEASED BY THORBJORG

Grettir went over the Thorskafjord Heath to Langadal, where he
let his hands sweep over the property of the smaller cultivators,
taking what he wanted from every one.  From some he got weapons,
from others clothes.  They gave up their property very variously,
but when he was gone all said that they had been compelled to do
it.

There dwelt on the Vatnsfjord one Vermund the Slender, a brother
of Viga-Styr, who had married Thorbjorg the daughter of Olaf
Peacock, the son of Hoskuld, called Thorbjorg the Fat.  At the
time when Grettir was in Langadal Vermund was away at the Thing. 
He went across the ridge to Laugabol where a man named Helgi was
living, one of the principal bondis.  Thence Grettir took a good
horse belonging to the bondi and rode on to Gervidal, where dwelt
a man named Thorkell.  He was well provided but in a small way of
business.  Grettir took from him what he wanted, Thorkell daring
neither to withhold anything nor to protest.  Thence Grettir went
to Eyr and on to the coast of the fjord, obtaining food and
clothes from every homestead and making himself generally
disagreeable, so that men found it hard to live while he was
about.

Grettir went boldly on, taking little care of himself.  He went
on until he came to Vatnsfjardardal and entered a dairy shelter,
where he stayed several nights.  There he lay sleeping in the
forest, fearing for nothing.  When the shepherds learned of it
they reported in the homesteads that a fiend had come into the
place who they thought would be hard to deal with.  All the
farmers came together and a band of thirty of them concealed
themselves in the forest where Grettir could not know of them. 
They set one of the shepherds to watch for an opportunity of
seizing him, without however knowing very clearly who the man
was.

One day when Grettir was lying asleep the farmers came up to him.

They considered how they should take him with least danger to
themselves, and arranged that ten should fall upon him while
others laid bonds round his feet.  They threw themselves on to
him, but Grettir struggled so violently that he threw them all
off and came down on his hands and knees.  Then they threw ropes
round his feet.  Grettir kicked two of them in the ears and they
fell senseless.  One came on after the other; long and hard he
struggled, but at last they succeeded in getting him down and
binding him.  Then they began to ask themselves what they were
going to do with him.  They asked Helgi of Laugabol to take him
over and look after him until Vermund returned from the Thing.

He said: "I have something better to do than to keep my men
guarding him.  I have labour enough with my lands, and he shall
not come in my way."

Then they asked Thorkell of Gervidal to take him and said he had
sufficient means.  He objected strongly and said he had no
accommodation for him, "I lie at home with my wife, far from
other men.  You shall not bring your basket to me."

"Then you, Thoralf of Eyr," they said; "you take Grettir and
look after him well while the Thing lasts, or else hand him on to
the next farm; only be answerable for his not escaping.  Give him
over bound, just as you receive him."

He said: "I am not going to take Grettir.  I have neither means
nor money to keep him, nor was he captured on my property.  So
far as I can see much more trouble than credit is to be got by
taking him or having anything to do with him.  He shall not enter
my house."

Each of the bondis was asked, but all refused.  Some witty person
wrote a poem about these confabulations and called it "Grettir's
Faring," adding many jests of his own for the dilectification of
men.  After parleying for a long time they all came to an
agreement that they would not throw away their luck, and set to
work to raise a gallows there and then in the forest upon which
Grettir should hang.  Their delight over this proposal was
uproarious.

Then they saw three people riding along the valley from below,
one of them in a dyed dress.  They guessed that it must be
Thorbjorg the mistress of Vatnsfjord on her way to the dairy, and
so it was.  Thorbjorg was a person of great magnificence, and
tremendously wise.  She was the leading personage of the district
and managed everything when Vermund was away.  She came up to
where the crowd was gathered and was lifted from her horse; the
bondis saluted her respectfully.  She said:

"What is your meeting about?  Who is this thick-necked man
sitting there in bonds?"

Grettir told his name and saluted her.

"What has moved you, Grettir," she said, "to commit violence upon
my Thing-men?"

"I cannot overlook everything," he said.  "I must be somewhere."

"You are indeed unfortunate," she said, "that a pack of churls
like these should have captured you and that none of them should
have paid for it.  What are you men going to do with him?"

The bondis said that they were going to hoist him on to a gallows
for his misdeeds.

She said: "It may be that Grettir has deserved it, but it will
bring trouble upon you men of Isafjord if you take the life of a
man so renowned and so highly connected as Grettir, ill-starred
though he be.  Now what will you do for your life, Grettir, if I
give it to you?"

"What do you wish me to do?"

"You shall swear never to commit any violence here in Isafjord;
nor shall you take revenge upon those who have had a hand in
capturing you."

Grettir said it should be as she desired, and he was released. 
He said it was the greatest effort of self-restraint that he ever
made that he did not thrash the men who were there triumphing
over him.  Thorbjorg told him to come home with her and gave him
a horse to ride on.  So he went to Vatnsfjord and stayed there
well cared for by the mistress until Vermund returned.  She
gained great renown from this deed through the district.  Vermund
was very much put out when he got home and asked why Grettir was
there.  Thorbjorg told him everything which had happened with the
Isafjord men.

"To what does he owe it that you gave him his life?" he asked.

"Many reasons there were," she said.  "The first is that you
might be the more respected as a chief for having a wife who
would dare to do such a thing.  Next, his kinswoman Hrefna will
surely say that I could not let him be slain; and thirdly,
because he is in many respects a man of the highest worth."

"You are a wise woman," he said, "in most things.  I thank you
for what you have done."

Then he said to Grettir: "You have sold yourself very cheap, such
a man of prowess as you are, to let yourself be taken by churls. 
This is what always happens to those who cannot control
themselves."

Grettir then spoke a verse:

     "Full was my cup in Isafjord
     when the old swine held me at ransom."

"What were they going to do with you when they took you?" Vermund
asked.

     "To Sigar's lot my neck was destined
     when noble Thorbjorg came upon them."

"Would they have hanged you then if they had been left to
themselves?"

     "My neck would soon have been in the noose,
     had she not wisely saved the bard."

"Did she invite you to her home?"

     "She bade me home with her to fare.
     A steed she gave me, life and peace."

"Great will your life be and troublous," said Vermund; "but now
you have learnt to beware of your foes.  I cannot keep you here,
for it would rouse the enmity of many powerful men against me.
Your best way is to seek your kinsmen; there are not many who
will be willing to take you in if they can do anything else; nor
are you one who will easily follow the will of another man."

Grettir remained for a time in Vatnsfjord and went thence to the
Western fjords and tried several of the leading men there, but
something always happened to prevent their taking him in.


CHAPTER LIII

GRETTIR WINTERS IN LJARSKOGAR WITH THORSTEINN KUGGASON

During the autumn Grettir returned to the South and did not stop
till he came to his kinsman Thorsteinn Kuggason in Ljarskogar,
who welcomed him.  He accepted Thorsteinn's invitation to stay
the winter with him.  Thorsteinn was a man who worked very hard;
he was a smith, and kept a number of men working for him. 
Grettir was not one for hard work, so that their dispositions did
not agree very well.  Thorsteinn had had a church built on his
lands, with a bridge from his house, made with much ingenuity. 
Outside the bridge, on the beam which supported it, rings were
fastened and bells, which could be heard from Skarfsstadir half a
sea-mile distant when any one walked over the bridge.  The
building of the bridge had cost Thorsteinn, who was a great
worker in iron, much labour.  Grettir was a first-rate hand at
forging the iron, but was not often inclined to work at it.  He
was very quiet during the winter so that there is not much to
relate.

The men of Hrutafjord heard that Grettir was with Thorsteinn, and
gathered their forces in the spring.  Thorsteinn then told
Grettir that he must find some other hiding-place for himself,
since he would not work.  Men who did nothing did not suit him.

"Where do you mean me to go to? "asked Grettir.

Thorsteinn told him to go South to his kinsmen, but to return to
him if he found them of no use.

Grettir did so.  He went to Borgarfjord in the South to visit
Grim the son of Thorhall, and stayed with him till the Thing was
over.  Grim sent him on to Skapti the Lawman at Hjalli.  He went
South over the lower heaths and did not stop before he reached
Tunga, where he went to Thorhall, the son of Asgrim the son of
Ellidagrim, and paid few visits to the farms around.  Thorhall
knew of Grettir through the relations which had been between
their ancestors; indeed Grettir's name was well known throughout
the country because of his exploits.  Thorhall was a wise man and
treated Grettir well, but did not want to keep him there for very
long.


CHAPTER LIV

ADVENTURE WITH LOPT

Grettir went from Tunga up the Haukadal valley northwards to Kjol
and was there for some time in the summer.  For men travelling
either to the North or to the South there was no certainty of
their not being stripped of what they had on them, for he was
hard pressed for the means of living.

One day when Grettir was keeping to the North near Dufunesskeid
he saw a man riding South along the Kjol valley.  He was a tall
man on horseback, riding a good horse with a studded bridle, and
was leading another horse loaded with sacks.  He had a slouched
hat on his head, so that his face was not clearly seen.  Grettir
was very pleased to see his horse and his property, and went to
meet him and asked him his name.  He said it was Lopt, and added:
"I know what your name is; you are Grettir the Strong, son of
Asmund.  Whither are you going?"

"I have not made up my mind yet about that," said Grettir.  "My
present business is to know whether you will lay off some of the
property which you are travelling with."

"Why should I give you what belongs to me?  What will you give me
for the things?"

"Have you not heard that I never pay anything?  And yet it seems
to most people that I get what I want."

Lopt said: "Make this offer to those who seem good to you; I am
not going to give my property away for nothing.  Let us each go
our own way."  Then he whipped on his horse and was about to ride
away from Grettir.

"We shall not part so quickly as that," said Grettir, and seized
the bridle of Lopt's horse in front of his hands, pulled it from
him and held it with both hands.

"Go your own way," said Lopt; "you will get nothing from me as
long as I am able to hold it."

"That shall now be tried," said Grettir.

Lopt reached down along the cheek-strap and got hold of the reins
between the end ring and Grettir's hands, pulling with such force
that Grettir let go, and at last Lopt wrenched the whole bridle
away from him.  Grettir looked at his palms and thought that this
man must have strength in his claws rather than not.  Then he
looked at him and said: "Where are you going to now?

He answered:

     "To the storm-driven den, over ice-clad heights,
     I ride to the rock and the rest of the hand."

Grettir said: "There is no certainty to be had from asking where
your dwelling is if you do not speak more clearly."  Then Lopt
spake and said:

     "I seek not to hide thy ways from thy ken.
     'Tis the place which the Borgfirdings Balljokull call."

Then they parted.  Grettir saw that he had no strength against
this man.  Then he spoke a verse:

     "Illugi brave and Atli were far.
     Never again may such hap be mine!
     The bridle was torn away from my hand.
     Her tears will flow when I am afeared."

After this Grettir left Kjol and went South to Hjalli where he
asked Skapti for shelter.  Skapti said: "I am told that you are
acting with violence and are robbing men of their property; that
ill becomes a man so highly connected as you are.  It would be
easier to negotiate if you gave up robbing.  Now as I am called
Lawman of this country, it would not be seemly for me to break
the law by harbouring outlaws.  I would like you to betake
yourself somewhere where you do not need to commit robbery."

Grettir said he would be very glad to, but that he could scarcely
live alone owing to his fear of the dark.  Skapti said he would
have to content himself with something short of the best: "And
trust no one so fully that what happened to you in the Western
fjords may be repeated.  Many have been brought to death by
over-confidence."

Grettir thanked him for his good advice and turned back to
Borgarfjord in the autumn, when he went to his friend Grim, the
son of Thorhall, and told him what Skapti had said.  Grim advised
him to go to the North to Fiskivotn in the Arnarvatn Heath, and
he did so.


CHAPTER LV

GRETTIR IN THE ARNARVATN HEATH.  DEATH OF GRIM THE FOREST-MAN

Grettir went up to the Arnarvatn Heath and built himself a hut
there of which the remains are still to be seen.  He went there
because he wanted to do anything rather than rob, so he got
himself a net and a boat and went out fishing to support himself.

It was a weary time for him in the mountains because of his fear
of the dark.  Other outlaws heard of his having come there and
wanted to go and see him, thinking that he would be a great
protection to them.

There was an outlaw from the North named Grim.  This man was
bribed by those of Hrutafjord to kill Grettir.  They promised him
pardon and money if he succeeded.  He went to visit Grettir and
asked for his hospitality.

Grettir said: "I do not see how you will be holpen by coming to
me, and you men of the forest are untrustworthy.  But it is ill
to live alone; I have no choice.  Only he shall be with me who is
willing to work at whatever comes to hand."

Grim said that was just what he wished and pressed Grettir much,
until Grettir let himself be persuaded and took him in.  He
stayed there right into the winter, and watched Grettir closely,
but it seemed no easy matter to attack him, for Grettir was
suspicious and kept his weapons at hand night and day; when he
was awake the man would not venture to approach him.

One morning Grim came home from fishing and went into the hut
stamping with his feet and wanting to know whether Grettir was
asleep.  Grettir lay still and did not move.  There was a short
sword hanging above his head.  Grim thought he would never have a
better opportunity.  He made a loud noise to see whether Grettir
took any notice, but he did not, so Grim felt sure that he was
asleep.  He crept stealthily to the bed, reached up to the sword,
took it down and raised it to strike. just at the moment when he
raised it Grettir sprang up on to the floor, and, seizing the
sword with one hand, Grim with the other, hurled him over so that
he fell nearly senseless.  "This is how you have proved yourself
with all your friendly seeming," he said.  Then he got the whole
truth out of him and killed him.  He learned from this what it
was to take in a forest-man.  So the winter passed.  The hardest
thing of all to bear was his fear of the dark.

CHAPTER LVI

TREACHERY AND DEATH OF THORIR REDBEARD

Thorir of Gard now heard where Grettir had taken up his abode and
meant to leave no stone unturned to get him slain.  There was a
man named Thorir Redbeard, a stout man and a great fighter, on
which account he had been declared outlaw throughout the country.

Thorir of Gard sent word to him, and when they met asked Redbeard
to undertake the business of slaying Grettir.  Redbeard said that
was no easy task, as Grettir was very wide awake and very
cautious.  Thorir told him to try it, saying: "It would be a
splendid deed for a valiant man like you; I will get your
outlawing removed and give you sufficient money as well."

So Redbeard agreed and Thorir told him how he should go to work
to deal with Grettir.  Redbeard then went away into the East in
order that Grettir might not suspect where he came from.  Thence
he came to the Arnarvatn Heath, where Grettir had then been for
one winter, found Grettir and asked him for entertainment.  He
said: "I cannot allow people to play with me again as the man
did who came here last autumn, pretending to be very friendly;
before he had been here very long be began plotting against my
life.  I cannot risk taking in anymore forest-men."

"I think you have reason," Thorir said, "to mistrust forest-men. 
It may be you have heard tell of me as a man of blood and a
disturber of peace, but never did you hear of such a monstrous
deed of me as that I betrayed my host.  Ill is the lot of him who
has an ill name; for men think of him but as such; nor would I
have come here if I had had any better choice.  All is not lost
for us if we stand together.  You might venture so much to begin
with as to try how you like me, and then if you find any
unfitness in me turn me away."

"Well," said Grettir, "I will risk it with you; but know of a
surety that if I suspect you of any treachery it will be your
death."

Thorir agreed.  Grettir took him in and found that in whatever he
did he had the strength of two men.  He was ready for anything
that Grettir gave him to do.  Nothing did Grettir need to do for
himself, and he had never lived so comfortably since he had
become an outlaw.  Nevertheless he was so wary that Thorir got no
chance.  Two years was Thorir Redbeard with Grettir on the Heath,
and at last he began to weary of it.  He thought over what he
could do to take Grettir off his guard.

One night in the spring a heavy gale sprang up while they were
asleep.  Grettir awoke and asked where their boat was.  Thorir
sprang up, ran to the boat, broke her all in pieces, and threw
the fragments about so that it looked as if the storm had wrecked
her.  Then he returned to the hut and said aloud: "You have had
bad luck, my friend.  Our boat is all broken in pieces and the
nets are lying far out in the lake."

"Get them back then," said Grettir.  "It seems to me to be your
doing that the boat is smashed."

"Of all things which I can do," said Thorir, "swimming is that
which suits me least.  In almost anything else I think I can hold
my own with any ordinary man.  You know very well that I have
been no burden to you since I came here; nor would I ask you to
do this if I were able to do it myself."

Grettir then arose, took his arms and went to the lake.  There
was a point of land running out into the lake with a large bay on
the further side of it. The water was deep up to the shore. 
Grettir said: "Swim out to the nets and let me see what you are
able to do."

"I told you before," Thorir said, "that I cannot swim.  I do not
know now where all your boldness and daring are gone to."

"I could get the nets," he said; "but betray me not if I trust
you."

"Do not think such shameful and monstrous things of me," said
Thorir.

"You will prove yourself what you are," Grettir said.

Then he threw off his clothes and his weapons and swain out to
the nets.  He gathered them together, returned to the shore and
cast them up on to the bank. just as he was about to land Thorir
quickly seized his short sword and drew it.  He ran towards
Grettir as he stepped on to the bank and aimed a blow at him. 
Grettir threw himself down backwards into the water and sank like
a stone.  Thorir stood by the shore intending to guard it until
he came up.  Grettir swam beneath the water, keeping close to the
bank so that Thorir could not see him, and so reached the bay
behind him, where he landed without letting himself be seen.  The
first Thorir knew of it was when Grettir lifted him up over his
head and dashed him down with such violence that the sword fell
out of his hand.  Grettir got possession of it and without
speaking a word cut off his head.  So his life ended.  After that
Grettir refused to take in any forest-men, and yet he could not
live alone.


CHAPTER LVII

ATTACK ON GRETTIR BY THORIR OF GARD WITH EIGHTY MEN REPULSED WITH
THE AID OF HALLMUND

At the All-Thing Thorir of Gard learned of Thorir Redbeard having
been killed.  It was evident that the matter was not so easy to
deal with.  He now determined to ride from the Thing in a
westerly direction through the lower heath, and with the aid of
about eighty men whom he had with him to take Grettir's life. 
Grim the son of Thorhall heard of his plans and sent word to
Grettir, bidding him beware of himself.  Grettir therefore
continued closely to watch the movements of men who came and
went.

One day he saw a number of men coming in the direction of his
place of dwelling.  He went into a gorge between two rocks, but
did not go right away because he did not see the whole of the
troop.  Thorir then came up with his whole party and bade them go
between his head and his body, saying that the scoundrel had but
a poor chance now.

"A filled cup is not yet drunk," answered Grettir.  "You have
come far to seek me, and some of you shall bear the marks of our
game before we part."

Thorir urged his men on to attack him.  The gorge was very narrow
so that he could easily defend it from one end, and he wondered
much that they did not get round to his rear to hurt him.  Some
of Thorir's men fell and some were wounded, but they effected
nothing.  Then Thorir said: "I always heard that Grettir was
distinguished for his courage and daring, but I never knew that
he was so skilled in magic as I now see he is; for there fall
half as many again behind his back as before his face, and I see
that we have to do with a troll instead of a man."

So he bade his men retire, and they did so.  Grettir wondered
what the explanation could be, but was terribly exhausted. 
Thorir and his men withdrew and rode into the northern parts. 
Their expedition was considered very disgraceful.  Thorir had
left eighteen men on the ground and had many wounded.

Grettir then went up the gorge and found there a man of huge
stature sitting up against the rock and sorely wounded.  Grettir
asked his name, and he said it was Hallmund, adding: "That you
may recognise me I may remind you that you thought I gripped the
reins rather tightly when I met you in Kjol last summer.  I think
I have now made that good."

"Indeed," said Grettir, "I think you have done me a manly
service; whenever I can I will repay it."

"Now I wish," said Hallmund, "that you may come to my home, for
it must seem wearisome to you here on the Heath."

Grettir said he would come willingly, and they both went together
to the foot of the Balljokull, where Hallmund had a large cave. 
There they found his daughter, a fine and well-grown maiden. 
They treated Grettir well, and the daughter nursed both the
wounded men to health again.  Grettir stayed there some time that
summer.  He composed an ode on Hallmund in which the line occurs:

     "Hallmund steps from his mountain hall";

further:

     "The war-fain sword in Arnarvatn
     went forth to hew its bloody path.
     Heroes inherit Kelduhverfi.
     Hallmund the brave came forth from his den."

It is said that at that encounter Grettir slew six men and
Hallmund twelve.

As the summer passed Grettir began to long for the habitations of
men, and to see his friends and kinsmen.  Hallmund told him to
visit him when he returned to the South and Grettir promised to
do so.  He went westwards to Borgarfjord and thence to
Breidafjardardalir and sought counsel of Thorsteinn Kuggason as
to where he should go next.  Thorsteinn said that his enemies
were now becoming so numerous that few would care to take him in;
but told him to_go to Myrar and see what he found there.  So in
the autumn he went to Myrar.


CHAPTER LVIII

GRETTIR VISITS BJORN THE HITDALE WARRIOR AND TAKES REFUGE IN THE
FAGRASKOGAFJALL

There lived in Holm Bjorn the Hitdale Warrior, who was the son of
Arngeir, the son of Bersi the Godless, the son of Balki, who was
the first settler in Hrutafjord, as has already been told.  Bjorn
was a great chief and a valiant man, always ready to take in
outlaws.  He received Grettir well when he came to Holm on
account of the friendship which had existed between their former
kinsmen.  Grettir asked if he would give him shelter, and Bjorn
said that he had so many quarrels throughout the land that men
would be reluctant to take him in for fear of being outlawed
themselves.  "But," he said, "I will give you some help if you
will leave the men who are under my protection in peace, whatever
you do to others in this part."

Grettir promised that he would, and Bjorn continued: "I have
thought of something.  In the mountain which stretches away from
the Hitara river there is a good position for defence, and
likewise a good hiding-place if it is skilfully managed.  There
is a hole through the mountain from which you can see down upon
the high road that lies immediately beneath it, and a sandy slope
down to the road so steep that few could get up it if it were
defended above by one doughty man up in the hollow.  It may, I
think, be worth your while to consider whether you can stay
there; it is easy to go down from there to the Myrar to get your
supplies, and to reach the sea."

Grettir said he would trust to his foresight if he would help him
a little.  Then he went to Fagraskogafjall and made himself a
home there.  He hung some grey wadmal in front of the hole, and
it looked from the road below as if one could see through.  Then
he began to get in his supplies, but the Myramen thought they had
an unhappy visitor in Grettir.

Thord the son of Kolbeinn was an excellent poet who dwelt in
Hitarnes.  There was a great feud between him and Bjorn at that
time, and Bjorn thought it would be more than half useful to him
if Grettir were to busy himself with Thord's men or his cattle. 
Grettir was a great deal with Bjorn and they had many games of
strength.  It is related in Bjorn's saga that they were
considered equal in strength, but the opinion of most people is
that Grettir was the strongest man that had been in the land
since the days when Orin Storolfsson and Thoralf Skolmsson ceased
their trials of strength.  Grettir and Bjorn swam in one course
the whole length of the Hitara from the lake at its head down to
the sea.  They brought the stepping-stones into the river which
neither floods nor freezing nor icedrifts have since moved from
their places.  Grettir stayed a year in Fagraskogafjall without
any attack being made upon him, and yet many lost their property
through his means and got nothing for it, because his position
was strong for defence and he was always in good friendship with
those who were nearest to him.


CHAPTER LIX

THE CHASTISEMENT OF GISLI

There was a man named Gisli; he was the son of that Thorsteinn
whom Snorri the Godi had caused to be slain.  He was a big strong
man, very ostentatious in his dress and in his armour, a man with
a high opinion of himself and very boastful.  He was a mariner,
and landed at the Hvita river in the summer after Grettir had
spent a winter in the mountains.  Thord the son of Kolbeinn rode
to his ship and was welcomed by Gisli, who offered him of his
wares whatever he cared to have.  Thord accepted his offer and
they began to have some talk together.  Gisli asked: "Is it true
what I hear that you are in difficulty how to rid yourself of a
forest-man who is doing you much hurt?" "We have made no attempt
yet," said Thord, "because a great many think he is difficult to
reach, and have found it so."

"It seems likely that you will have trouble with Bjorn, unless
you drive him away.  All the worse it is that I must be too far
away next winter to give you any help."

"It is better for you to know of him only by hearsay."

"Don't talk to me about Grettir," said Gisli.  "I have been in
much greater straits in my campaigns with King Knut the Mighty
and in the western seas, where I was always considered to have
held my own.  Only let me come within reach of him and I will
trust myself and my armour."

Thord answered that he should not do it for nothing if he killed
Grettir: "There is more money on his head than on that of any
other outlaw.  First there were six marks of silver, this summer
Thorir of Gard added three more, and men think that he who wins
it will have had enough trouble."

"Everything will be attempted for money," said Gisli: "especially
with us traders.  But we must keep quiet about what we have been
saying, for Grettir will be more on his guard if he hears that
you have taken me into your counsels.  I intend next winter to be
at Olduhrygg; is there any hiding-place of his on my way there? 
He will not be prepared for this, and I shall not take many men
with me to attack him."

Thord approved of his proposal.  He rode home soon after and kept
very quiet about it.  And now was proved what has often been
said, that: Off in the woods is a listener nigh.  Men who were
friends of Bjorn in Hitardal overheard their conversation and
reported it accurately to him.  Bjorn told Grettir of it when
they met, and said now he should see how to encounter him.  "It
would be no bad joke," he said, "if you were to injure him in
some way without killing him if you can."

Grettir grinned but said little.  Towards the time of gathering
in the cattle Grettir went down to Flysjuhverfi to get some sheep
and got four wethers.  The bondis heard of his having come and
went after him.  They came up just at about the moment when he
reached the foot of his mountain and wanted to drive the sheep
away from him.  But they would not attack him with weapons. 
There were six of them and they stood across his path to bar his
way.  He was concerned about his sheep, got angry, seized three
of them and threw them down the hill so that they lay senseless. 
The others when they saw it went at him, but rather
halfheartedly.  Grettir took the sheep, fastened them together by
the horns, threw two over each shoulder and carried them off. 
Then he went up into his den.  The bondis turned back feeling
they had had the worst of it, and were more discontented with
their lot than ever.

Gisli stayed with his ship that autumn until she was ready to be
hauled up.  Several things happened to delay him, so that he was
late in getting away and rode off very little before the winter
nights.  Then he rode North and stayed at Hraun on the south bank
of the Hitara.  Next morning before he rode out he said to his
servants: "Now we will ride in red clothes and let the forest-man
see that we are not like the other travellers who beat about here
every day."

There were three of them and they did as he bade.  When they had
crossed the river he said: "Here I am told dwells the forest-man,
up in that peak; but the way is not an easy one.  Would it not
please him to come to us and see our array?"  They said this was
always his habit.

That morning Grettir had got up early.  The weather was cold, it
was freezing and some snow had fallen, but very little.  He saw
three men riding from the South across the Hitara, and the light
shone from their apparel and from their enamelled shields.  It
occurred to Grettir who it might be, and he thought he would
relieve them of some of their accoutrements.  He was very curious
to meet a man who went about so ostentatiously.  So he took his
weapons and hurried down the hillside.  Gisli when he heard the
clattering of the stones said: "A man, rather tall, is coming
down the hill and wants to meet us.  Let us act boldly and we
shall have good sport."  His men said that this fellow had great
confidence in himself to run into their hands; but that he who
asked should have.  Then they got off their horses.  Grettir came
up to them and laid hold of a bag of clothes which Gisli had
behind him on his saddle, saying:

"I must have this; I often stoop to little things."

Gisli said: "You shall not; do not you know with whom you have to
do?"

Grettir said: "No; that is not so clear to me.  Nor do I make
much difference between one man and another since I claim so
little."

"May be it seems little to you," said Gisli; "but I would sooner
part with thirty hundred ells of wadmal.  It seems that extortion
is your way.  Go for him, boys!  Let us see what he can do."

They obeyed.  Grettir fell back a little and reached a stone
which is still standing by the side of the way and is called
Grettishaf, where he stood at bay.  Gisli urged on his men, and
Grettir saw that he was not quite so valiant as he pretended to
be, for he kept well behind them.  Grettir got tired of being
hemmed in, so he made a lunge with his sword and killed one of
Gisli's men, sprang from his stone and assailed them so
vigorously that Gisli fell back all along the foot of the hill. 
Then his other man was killed.

Grettir said: "One would scarcely see that you have achieved
much in the world abroad, and you have shamefully forsaken your
comrades."

Gisli answered: "The fire is hottest to him who is in it; it is
ill dealing with men from Hel."

They had exchanged few more blows when Gisli threw away his arms
and bolted right away along the foot of the mountain.  Grettir
gave him time to throw away whatever he liked, and at every
opportunity he threw off something more of his clothes.  Grettir
never followed him so closely that there was not some distance
between them.  He ran right away from the mountains, across
Kaldardal, round Aslaug's Cliff, above Kolbeinsstad and out to
Borgarhraun.

By that time he had nothing left on him but his shirt, and was
terribly exhausted.  Grettir still followed, keeping now within
reach of him.  He pulled off a great branch.  Gisli did not stop
till he reached Haffjardara river, which was all swollen and
difficult to ford.  Gisli was going right out into the river when
Grettir pressed forward and seized him and showed him the
difference in their strength.

Grettir got him down, sat on the top of him and asked: "Are you
the Gisli who wanted to meet Grettir?"

"I have found him now," he answered; "but I know not how I shall
part with him.  Keep what you have taken and let me go free."

Grettir said: "You will not understand what I am going to tell
you, so I must give you something to remember it by."  Then he
pulled up Gisli's shirt over his head and let the rod play on
both sides of his back.  Gisli struggled to get away, but Grettir
gave him a sound whipping and then let him go.  Gisli thought
that he would sooner not learn anything from Grettir than have
another such flogging, nor did he do anything more to earn it. 
Directly he got his feet under him again he ran off to a large
pool and swam across the river.  In the evening he reached the
settlement called Hrossholt, very exhausted.  There he lay for a
week, his body covered with blisters, and afterwards went on to
his own place.

Grettir turned back, gathered up all the things which Gisli had
thrown away and took them home.  Gisli never got them back again;
many thought be had only got what he deserved for his noisy
boasting.  Grettir made a verse about their encounter:

     "The horse whose fighting teeth are blunted
     runs from the field before his foe.
     With many an afterthought ran Gisli.
     Gone is his fame, his glory lost!"

In the spring after this Gisli prepared to go on board his ship
and forbade in the strongest terms anything which belonged to him
being carried South by the way of the mountains; for he said that
the Fiend himself was there.  Gisli when he went South to join
his ship kept all the way along the coast and he never met
Grettir again.  Nobody considered him worth thinking about, nor
do we hear any more of him in this saga.  Grettir's relations
with Thord the son of Kolbeinn became worse than ever, and Thord
tried every means to get Grettir driven away or killed.


CHAPTER LX

THE BATTLE WITH THE MYRAMEN

When Grettir had been two winters in Fagraskogafjall and the
third winter had set in, he went South into Myrar to the farm
called Laekjarbug, where he took six wethers without their
owner's permission.  Then he went down to Akrar and drove off two
oxen for slaughter with several sheep, and went up South to the
Hitara.  When the bondis heard of his exploits they sent word to
Thord at Hitarnes and asked him to take the lead in the slaying
of Grettir.  He was rather reluctant, but as they had asked him
he sent his son Arnor, afterwards called Jarlsbard, to go with
them, and told them not to let Grettir escape.  Messengers were
then sent round to all the farms.

There was a man named Bjarni who dwelt in Jorvi in Flysjuhverfi. 
He collected men on the other side of the Hitara; the intention
was that each band should keep on its own side.  Grettir had two
men with him, one named Eyjolf, a stout man, the son of a bondi
in Fagraskogar, and another.  The party came on, about twenty in
number, under Thorarin from Akrar and Thorfinn of Laekjarbug. 
Grettir tried to get out across the river, but was met by Arnor
and Bjarni coming from the coast.  There was a narrow point
jutting out into the river on Grettir's side, and when he saw the
men approaching he drove his animals on to it, for he never would
let go anything of which he had once got possession.  The Myramen
prepared to attack in good order and Grettir told his companions
to guard his rear.  They could not all come on at once.  There
was a hard struggle between them; Grettir used his short sword
with both hands and they found it not easy to get at him.  Some
of the Myramen fell and some were wounded.  The men on the other
side of the river were rather slow in coming up because there was
no ford near.  Before they had been fighting very long they fell
back.  Thorarin of Akrar was a very old man and not able to join
in the fighting.  When the battle was over there came up his son
Thrand, his brother Ingjald's son Thorgils, Finnbogi the son of
Thorgeir, the son of Thorhadd of Hitardal, and Steinolf the son
of Thorleif of Hraundal.  They set on their men and there was a
hard struggle.

Grettir saw that there was no choice left but either to flee or
else to do his utmost and not spare himself.  He pressed on hard
and nothing could hold against him, for his foes were so numerous
that there was no chance of escaping except by fighting to the
last before he fell.  He tried always to engage those who seemed
most courageous; first he went for Steinolf of Hraundal and cleft
his skull down to his shoulders; then he struck at Thorgils the
son of Ingjald and almost cut him in two.  Then Thrand tried to
spring forward and avenge his kinsmen, and Grettir hewed at his
right thigh, cutting out all the muscles so that he could fight
no more.  Next he gave Finnbogi a severe wound.  Then Thorarin
ordered them off.  "The longer you fight," he said, "the worse
you will get from him and the more will he choose out the men
from your company."

They obeyed and fell back.  Ten had fallen; five were wounded to
death or crippled, and nearly all who had been in the battle were
hurt.  Grettir was terribly fatigued but little wounded.  The
Myramen drew off, having suffered heavy losses, for many a good
man had fallen.  Those who were beyond the river came over slowly
and did not arrive till the fight was over, and when they saw the
plight of their men Arnor would not risk himself any further, for
which he was much blamed by his father and by others.  Men
thought he was not much of a warrior.  The place where they
fought is now called Grettisoddi.

Grettir and his companions were all wounded; they took their
horses and rode back along the foot of the mountain.  When they
reached Fagraskogar Eyjolf was behind.  There was a bondi's
daughter there and she asked for their tidings, which Grettir
told her fully and spoke a verse:

     "Goddess of horn-floods!  Steinolf's wounds
     are such that scarcely may be healed.
     Of Thorgils' life is little hope;
     his bones are smashed; eight more are dead."

Then Grettir went to his retreat and spent the winter there.


CHAPTER LXI

GRETTIR WINTERS UNDER THE GEITLAND GLACIER

The next time that Bjorn met Grettir he told him that this was a
very serious affair, and that he would not be able to stay there
in peace much longer.  "You have killed kinsmen and friends of
mine, but I will not depart from my promise to you so long as you
are here."

Grettir said he was sorry to have given him offence, but that he
had to defend his hands and his life.  Bjorn said it would have
to remain so.  Soon there came to him some of the men who had
lost their kinsmen through Grettir and petitioned him not to
allow such a ruffian as he was to stay there any longer and
molest them.  Bjorn said he would do as they desired directly the
winter was over.

Thrand the son of Thorarin of Akrar had now recovered from his
wound.  He was a man of much worth, and had married Steinunn the
daughter of Hrut of Kambsnes.  Steinolf's father Thorleif of
Hraundal was a great man; from him are sprung the Hraundal men.

No more meetings are told of between Grettir and the Myramen
while he was in the mountains.  Bjorn continued in friendship
with him, but some of Bjorn's other friends fell away from him
because of his allowing Grettir to remain there, for they were
annoyed at getting no compensation for the slaying of their
kinsmen.  When the Thing assembled Grettir left the Myrar
district and went to Borgarfjord, where he visited Grim the son
of Thorhall and sought counsel of him where he should move to
next.  Grim said he was not powerful enough to keep him there, so
Grettir went off to his friend Hallmund and stayed there till the
end of the summer.

In the autumn Grettir went to Geitland, where he stayed till
bright weather set in.  Then he ascended the Geitlandsjokull and
turned his steps South-east along the glacier, taking with him a
kettle and fuel.  It is supposed that he went there by the
counsel of Hallmund, who knew the country far and wide.  He went
on till he came to a long and rather narrow valley in the
glacier, shut in on every side by the ice which overhung the
valley.  He went about everywhere, and found fair grass-grown
banks and brushwood.  There were hot springs, and it seemed as if
volcanic fires had kept the ice from closing in above the valley.

A little stream flowed down the dale with smooth banks on either
side.  Little did the light of the sun enter there, and the
number of sheep in the valley seemed to him countless.  They were
much better and fatter than any which he had ever seen.

Grettir stayed there and built himself a hut out of logs which he
found about.  He caught a sheep to eat, and it was better for
slaughter than two in other places.  There was a ewe there with
her lamb; she had a brown head and excelled all the others in
size.  He was anxious to have the lamb, so he caught it and
slaughtered it and got half a measure of suet out of it, and it
was better in every way.  When Brownhead missed her lamb she came
up every night to Grettir's hut and bleated so that he never
could get any sleep.  He regretted much having killed the lamb on
account of the disturbance which she caused him.  Every evening
when the twilight set in he heard a voice calling in the valley,
and then the sheep used to run together into a place of shelter. 
Grettir has told us that a blending ruled over the valley, a
giant named Thorir, under whose protection he remained.  Grettir
called the valley after him Thorisdal.  He said that Thorir had
daughters with whom he had some play, and that they were very
pleased, because not many people came there.  And when the days
of fasting came Grettir remembered to tell them that fat and
liver should be eaten in Lent.  Nothing particular occurred that
winter, and Grettir found it so dull that he could not stay there
any longer.  He left the valley and went to the South through the
glacier, reaching the middle of Skjaldbreid from the North. 
There he took up a stone, cut a hole in it and said that if a man
put his eye to the hole he could see into the gully which flows
out of Thorisdal.  Then he went across the country South and
reached the eastern fjords.  He spent the summer and the winter
on this journey and visited all the great men, but found them all
against him so that nowhere could he get lodging or shelter.  So
he returned to the North and stayed in various places.


CHAPTER LXII

HALLMUND IS KILLED BY A FOREST-MAN NAMED GRIM

Soon after Grettir had left the Arnarvatn Heath there came a man
there named Grim, the son of a widow at Kropp.  He had killed the
son of Eid of Ass, the son of Skeggi, and been outlawed for it. 
So there he stayed where Grettir had been before him and got
plenty of fish out of the lake.  Hallmund was not at all pleased
at Grim being there instead of Grettir, and said that he should
have little advantage from his great catches of fish.  One
morning Grim had caught a hundred fish, which he brought to the
hut and arranged outside.  The next morning when he went there
every fish was gone.  He thought it very strange, but returned to
the lake and caught this time two hundred.  He carried them home
and arranged them; again everything happened as before; in the
morning all were gone, evidently through the same agency as
before.  The third day he caught three hundred, carried them home
and kept a watch on his hut.  He looked out through a hole in the
door to see if any one came, and so he remained for a time.  When
about one third of the night had passed he heard some one walking
near and stepping rather heavily; so he immediately took his axe,
which was very sharp, and wanted to know what was the matter. 
There came a man with a big basket on his back; he put it down
and looked round, but saw no one outside.  He rummaged about
among the fish and seemed to think that they would do for him to
lay hands upon.  He threw them all into his basket and they quite
filled it. The fishes were so large that Grim thought no horse
would be able to carry more.  This man then took the load and got
beneath it.  Just as he was about to rise Grim rushed out and
taking his axe in both hands struck a blow at his neck which went
through the skin.  He started in surprise and then ran off
towards the south of the hill with his basket.  Grim went after
him to see whether he had got him.  They went south along the
foot of the Balljokull where the man entered a cave.  There was a
bright fire in the cave and a woman standing in it, very tall but
shapely.  Grim heard her greet her father, calling him Hallmund. 
He flung down his load and heaved a great sigh.  She asked why he
was covered with blood.  He answered in a verse:

     "No man, I see, may trust his might.
     His luck and heart will fail at death."

Then she pressed him to say what had happened, and he told her
everything.

"Hear now," he said, "what I tell you of my adventure.  I will
tell it to you in verse, and you shall cut it in runes on a
staff."

She did so, and he spoke the Hallmundarkvida, in which the
following occurs:

     "I was strong when Grettir's bridle I seized
     I saw him gazing long at his palms.

     Then Thorir came on the Heath with his men.
     'Gainst eighty we two had play with our spears.

     Grettir's hands knew how to strike;
     much deeper the marks that were left by mine.

     Arms and heads then flew as they tried
     to gain my rear; eighteen of them fell.

     The giant-kind and the grim rock-dwellers,
     demons and blendings fell before me,
     elves and devils have felt my hand."

Many exploits of his did Hallmund recount in the lay, for he had
been in every land.

The daughter said: "That man was not going to let his catch slip
away from him.  It was only to be expected, for you treated him
very badly.  But who is going to avenge you?"

"It is not certain that anybody will, but I think that Grettir
would avenge me if he were able.  It will not be easy to go
against this man's luck; he is destined to great things."  Then
as the lay continued his strength began to fail.  Hallmund died
almost at the moment when he finished the song.  She grieved much
for him and wept sorely.  Then Grim came forward and bade her be
comforted.  "All," he said, "must depart when their fate calls. 
It was partly his own fault, for I could not look on and see
myself robbed."

She said he might speak much about that: "The unjust man
prospers ill."

She was somewhat cheered by the talk with him.  Grim stayed
several nights in the cave and learned the lay; all went well
with them.  Grim was in the Arnarvatn Heath all the winter after
Hallmund's death.  Afterwards Thorkell the son of Eyjolf came to
the heath and fought with him.  The meeting ended by Grim having
Thorkell's life in his power, but he would not kill him. 
Thorkell then took him in, sent him abroad and supplied him with
means; each was considered to have acted generously towards the
other.  Grim became a great traveller and there is a long saga
about him.


CHAPTER LXIII

GRETTIR'S MEETING WITH THORIR ON THE REYKJA HEATH

We now return to Grettir, who came from the eastern fjords,
travelling in disguise and hiding his head because he did not
wish to meet Thorir.  That summer he spent in Modrudal Heath and
other places.  For a time too he was on Reykja Heath.  Thorir
heard of his being on Reykja Heath, gathered his men and rode
thither, determined not to let him escape.  Grettir scarcely knew
of their plans before they came upon him.  He was in a hill-dairy
a little off the road with another man, and when they saw the
troop they had to lay their plans quickly.  Grettir said they
should make their horses lie down inside the house, and they did
so.  Thorir rode forward across the heath in a northerly
direction, missed the place, did not find Grettir and turned back
home.  When the troop had ridden round to the West, Grettir said:
"They will not be pleased with their expedition if they do not
meet me.  You stay and mind the horses while I go after them.  It
would be a good jest if they did not recognise me."

His companion tried to dissuade him, but he would go.  He changed
his dress, put on a wide hat which came down over his face and
took a stick in his hand.  Then he went along the road towards
them.  They addressed him and asked whether he had seen any men
riding over the heath.

"I have seen the men whom you are seeking," he said, "you very
nearly came upon them; they were on your left hand just south of
the marshes."

On hearing this they galloped off towards the marshes, which were
so swampy that they could not get through and had to spend a
great part of the day dragging their horses out.  They swore much
at the supposed traveller for playing a practical joke upon them.

Grettir returned speedily home to his companion, and when they
met spoke a verse:

     "I will not ride to the warriors' arms;
     too great the danger is.
     I dare not meet the storm of Vidri;
     but homeward turn my steps."

They rode off as fast as they could westwards towards the
homestead in Gard before Thorir could come there with his
company.  When they were near the place they met a man on the
road who did not know them.  There was a young woman standing
outside, very much dressed up, and Grettir asked who she was. 
The man who had come up said she was Thorir's daughter.  Then
Grettir spoke a verse:

     "Maiden, when thy father comes
     tell him, little though it please him,
     how I rode his dwelling past;
     only two who with me rode."

From this the man learnt who it was, and rode to the house to
tell them that Grettir had come round.  When Thorir returned many
men thought that he had been bamboozled by Grettir.  He then set
spies to watch Grettir's movements.  Grettir took the precaution
of sending his companion to the western districts with his horse,
while he himself went North into the mountains at the beginning
of the winter, muffling up his face so that no one should
recognise him.  Every one thought that Thorir had fared no better
but even worse than at their former encounter.


CHAPTER LXIV

GHOSTS IN BARDARDAL

There was dwelling at Eyjardalsa in Bardardal a priest named
Steinn, a good farmer and wealthy.  His son Kjartan was grown up
and was now a fine young man.  Thorsteinn the White was a man who
dwelt at Sandhaugar to the south of Eyjardalsa; his wife Steinvor
was young and of a merry disposition.  They had children who at
this time were yet young.  Their place was generally thought to
be much haunted by trolls.  Two winters before Grettir came North
into those parts, Steinvor the mistress of Sandhaugar went as
usual to spend Yule at Eyjardalsa, while her husband stayed at
home.  Men lay down to sleep in the evening, and in the night
they heard a great noise in the room near the bondi's bed.  No
one dared to get up to see what was the matter because there were
so few of them.  The mistress of the house returned home the next
morning, but her husband had disappeared and no one knew what had
become of him.  So the next season passed.  The following winter
the mistress wanted to go to mass, and told her servant to stay
at home; he was very unwilling but said she should be obeyed.  It
happened just as before; this time the servant disappeared. 
People thought it very strange and found some drops of blood upon
the outer door, so they supposed that some evil spirit must have
carried off both the men.  The story spread all through the
district and came to the ears of Grettir, who being well
accustomed to deal with ghosts and spectres turned his steps to
Bardardal and arrived at Yule-eve at Sandhaugar.  He retained his
disguise and called himself Gest.  The lady of the house saw that
he was enormously tall, and the servants were terribly afraid of
him.  He asked for hospitality; the mistress told him that food
was ready for him but that he must see after himself.  He said he
would, and added: "I will stay in the house while you go to mass
if you would like it."

She said: "You must be a brave man to venture to stay in the
house."

"I do not care for a monotonous life," he said.

Then she said: "I do not want to remain at home, but I cannot get
across the river."

"I will come with you," said Gest.  Then she made ready to go to
mass with her little daughter.  It was thawing outside; the river
was flooded and was covered with ice.  She said: "It is
impossible for either man or horse to cross the river."

"There must be fords," said Gest; "do not be afraid."

"First carry the maiden over," she said; "she is lighter."

"I don't want to make two journeys of it," said he; "I will carry
you in my arms."

She crossed herself and said: "That is impossible; what will you
do with the girl?"

"I will find a way," he said, taking them both up and setting
the girl on her mother's knee as he bore them both on his left
arm, keeping his right arm free.  So he carried them across. 
They were too frightened to cry out.  The river came up to his
breast, and a great piece of ice drove against him, which he
pushed off with the hand that was free.  Then the stream became
so deep that it broke over his shoulder, but he waded on
vigorously till he reached the other bank and put them on shore. 
It was nearly dark by the time he got home to Sandhaugar and
called for some food.  When he had eaten something he told the
servants to go to the other end of the hall.  Then he got some
boards and loose logs and laid them across the hall to make a
great barricade so that none of the servants could get across. 
No one dared to oppose him or to object to anything.  The
entrance was in the side wall of the hall under the back gable,
and near it was a cross bench upon which Grettir laid himself,
keeping on his clothes, with a light burning in the room.  So he
lay till into the night.

The mistress reached Eyjardalsa for mass and every one wondered
how she had crossed the river.  She said she did not know whether
it was a man or a troll who had carried her over.  The priest
said it was certainly a man though unlike other men.  "Let us
keep silence over it; may be that he means to help you in your
difficulties."

She stayed there the night.


CHAPTER LXV

ADVENTURE WITH A TROLL-WOMAN

We return now to tell of Gest.  Towards midnight he heard a loud
noise outside, and very soon there walked a huge troll-wife into
the room.  She carried a trough in one hand and a rather large
cutlass in the other.  She looked round the room as she entered,
and on seeing Gest lying there she rushed at him; he started up
and attacked her furiously.  They fought long together; she was
the stronger but he evaded her skilfully.  Everything near them
and the panelling of the back wall were broken to pieces.  She
dragged him through the hall door out to the porch, where he
resisted vigorously.  She wanted to drag him out of the house,
but before that was done they had broken up all the fittings of
the outer door and borne them away on their shoulders.  Then she
strove to get to the river and among the rocks.  Gest was
terribly fatigued, but there was no choice but either to brace
himself or be dragged down to the rocks.  All night long they
struggled together, and he thought he had never met with such a
monster for strength.  She gripped him so tightly to herself that
he could do nothing with either hand but cling to her waist. 
When at last they reached a rock by the river he swung the
monster round and got his right hand loose.  Then he quickly
seized the short sword which he was wearing, drew it and struck
at the troll's right shoulder, cutting off her right arm and
releasing himself.  She sprang among the rocks and disappeared in
the waterfall.  Gest, very stiff and tired, lay long by the rock.

At daylight he went home and lay down on his bed, blue and
swollen all over.

When the lady of the house came home she found the place rather
in disorder.  She went to Gest and asked him what had happened,
and why everything was broken to pieces.  He told her everything
just as it had happened.  She thought it a matter of great moment
and asked him who he was.  He told her the truth, said that he
wished to see a priest and asked her to send for one.  She did
so; Steinn came to Sandhaugar and soon learnt that it was Grettir
the son of Asmund who had come there under the name of Gest.  The
priest asked him what he thought had become of the men who had
disappeared; Grettir said he thought that they must have gone
among the rocks.  The priest said he could not believe his word
unless he gave some evidence of it.  Grettir said that later it
would be known, and the priest went home.  Grettir lay many days
in his bed and the lady did all she could for him; thus Yule-tide
passed.  Grettir himself declared that the trollwoman sprang
among the rocks when she was wounded, but the men of Bardardal
say that the day dawned upon her while they were wrestling; that
when he cut off her arm she broke, and that she is still standing
there on the mountain in the likeness of a woman.  The dwellers
in the valley kept Grettir there in hiding.

One day that winter after Yule Grettir went to Eyjardalsa and met
the priest, to whom he said: "I see, priest, that you have little
belief in what I say.  Now I wish you to come with me to the
river and to see what probability there is in it."

The priest did so.  When they reached the falls they saw a cave
up under the rock.  The cliff was there so abrupt that no one
could climb it, and nearly ten fathoms down to the water.  They
had a rope with them.  The priest said: "It is quite impossible
for any one to get down to that."

Grettir answered: "It is certainly possible; and men of high
mettle are those who would feel themselves happiest there.  I
want to see what there is in the fall.  Do you mind the rope."

The priest said he could do so if he chose.  He drove a stake
into the ground and laid stones against it.


CHAPTER LXVI

GRETTIR SLAYS A GIANT

Grettir now fastened a stone in a loop at the end of the rope,
and lowered it from above into the water.

"Which way do you mean to go?" asked the priest.

"I don't mean to be bound when I come into the fall," Grettir
said.  "So my mind tells me."

Then he prepared to go; he had few clothes on and only a short
sword; no other arms.  He jumped from a rock and got down to the
fall.  The priest saw the soles of his feet but after that did
not know what had become of him.  Grettir dived beneath the fall.

It was very difficult swimming because of the currents, and he
had to dive to the bottom to get behind the fall.  There was a
rock where he came up, and a great cave under the fall in front
of which the water poured.  He went into the cave, where there
was a large fire burning and a horrible great giant most fearful
to behold sitting before it.  On Grettir entering the giant
sprang up, seized a pike and struck at him, for he could both
strike and thrust with it.  It had a wooden shaft and was of the
kind called "heptisax."  Grettir struck back with his sword and
cut through the shaft.  Then the giant tried to reach up
backwards to a sword which was hanging in the cave, and at that
moment Grettir struck at him and cut open his lower breast and
stomach so that all his entrails fell out into the river and
floated down the stream.  The priest who was sitting by the rope
saw some debris being carried down all covered with blood and
lost his head, making sure that Grettir was killed.  He left the
rope and ran off home, where he arrived in the evening and told
them for certain that Grettir was dead, and said it was a great
misfortune to them to have lost such a man.

Grettir struck few more blows at the giant before he was dead. 
He then entered the cave, kindled a light and explored.  It is
not told how much treasure he found there, but there is supposed
to have been some.  He stayed there till late into the night and
found the bones of two men, which he carried away in a skin. 
Then he came out of the cave, swam to the rope and shook it,
thinking the priest was there; finding him gone he had to swarm
up the rope and so reached the top.  He went home to Eyjardalsa
and carried the skin with the bones in it into the vestibule of
the church together with a rune-staff, upon which were most
beautifully carved the following lines:

     "Into the fall of the torrent I went;
     dank its maw towards me gaped.
     The floods before the ogress' den
     Mighty against my shoulder played";

and then:

     "Hideous the friend of troll-wife came.
     Hard were the blows I dealt upon him.
     The shaft of Heptisax was severed.
     My sword has pierced the monster's breast."

There too it was told how Grettir had brought the bones from the
cave.  The priest when he came to the church on the next morning
found the staff and all that was with it and read the runes. 
Grettir had then returned home to Sandhaugar.


CHAPTER LXVII

VISIT TO GUDMUND THE MIGHTY

When the priest met Grettir again he asked him to say exactly
what bad happened, and Grettir told him all about where he had
been.  He said that the priest had held the rope very
faithlessly, and the priest admitted that it was true.  Men felt
no doubt that these monsters were responsible for the
disappearance of the men in the valley, nor was there any
haunting or ghost-walking there afterwards; Grettir had evidently
cleared the land of them.  The bones were buried by the priest in
the churchyard.  Grettir stayed the winter in Bardardal, but
unknown to the general public.

Thorir of Gard heard rumours of Grettir being in Bardardal and
set some men on to take his life.  Men thereupon advised him to
depart, and he went into the West to Modruvellir, where he met
Gudmund the Mighty and asked him for protection.  Gudmund said it
would not be convenient for him to take him in.

"You must," he said, "find a place to settle in where you need be
in no fear for your life."

Grettir said he did not know where such a place was.

"There is an island," Gudmund said, "in Skagafjord, called
Drangey.  It is excellent for defence; no one can get up to it
without a ladder.  If once you can reach it there is no chance of
any one attacking you there with arms or with craft, so long as
you guard the ladder well."

"That shall be tried," said Grettir.  "But I am in such dread
of the dark that even for the sake of my life I cannot live
alone."

"It may be that it is so," said Gudmund; "but trust no man so
well that you trust not yourself better.  Many are unfit to be
trusted."

Grettir thanked him for his excellent advice and departed from
Modruvellir.  He went on straight to Bjarg, where his mother and
Illugi greeted him joyfully.  He stayed there several days and
heard of Thorsteinn Kuggason having been slain in the autumn
before he went to Bardardal.  Fate, he thought, was striking hard
against him.  Then he rode South to Holtavarda Heath, intending
to revenge the death of Hallmund if he could meet with Grim.  On
reaching Nordrardal he learnt that Grim had left two or three
years before, as has already been related.  Grettir had not
received news of it because he had been in hiding there for two
years and a third in Thorisdal and had met no one to tell him of
what had happened.  Then he turned his steps towards the
Breidafjord valleys and waylaid those who passed over
Brattabrekka.  He continued to let his hands sweep over the
property of the small farmers during the height of the summer
season.

When the summer was passing away, Steinvor at Sandhaugar gave
birth to a son who was named Skeggi.  He was at first fathered on
Kjartan, the son of Steinn the priest at Eyjardalsa.  Skeggi was
unlike all his family in his strength and stature.  When he was
fifteen years old he was the strongest man in the North, and then
they put him down to Grettir.  There seemed a prospect of his
growing into something quite extraordinary, but he died when he
was seventeen and there is no saga about him.


CHAPTER LXVIII

FIGHT WITH THORODD THE SON OF SNORRI

After the death of Thorsteinn Kuggason, Snorri the Godi was on
bad terms with his son Thorodd and with Sam the son of Bork the
Fat.  It is not clearly stated what they had done to displease
him except that they had refused to undertake some important work
which he had given them to do; what is known is that Snorri
turned off his son Thorodd and told him not to come back until he
had slain some forest-man, and so it remained.  Thorodd then went
to Dalir.  There dwelt at Breidabolstad in Sokkolfsdal a certain
widow named Geirlaug; she kept as her shepherd a grown-up youth
who had been outlawed for wounding some one.  Thorodd Snorrason
heard of this, rode to Breidabolstad and asked where the shepherd
was.  The woman said he was with the sheep and asked what Thorodd
wanted with him.

"I want to take his life," he said; "he is an outlaw and a
forest-man."

She said: "Such a warrior as you has nothing to gain by killing a
miserable creature like him.  I will show you a much doughtier
deed, should you have a mind to try it."

"What is that?" he asked.

"Up there in the mountains," she said, "is Grettir the son of
Asmund; deal with him; that will be more fitting for you."

Thorodd liked the proposal and said he would do it.  Then he put
spurs to his horse and rode up along the valleys.  On reaching
the hills below the Austra river he saw a light-coloured horse
saddled, with a big man in armour, and at once directed his steps
towards them.  Grettir hailed him and asked who he was.  Thorodd
told his name and asked: "Why do you not rather ask my business
than my name?"

"Because," he said, "it is not likely to be very weighty.  Are
you a son of Snorri the Godi?"

"So it is indeed; we shall now try which of us is the stronger."

"That is easily done," said Grettir, "but have you not heard
that I have not proved a mound of wealth to most of those who
have had to do with me?"

"I know that; but I mean to risk something on it now."

Then he drew his sword and went valiantly for Grettir, who
defended himself with his shield but would not use his weapons
against Thorodd.  They fought for a time without his being
wounded.  Grettir then said:

"Let us stop this play; you will not gain the victory in a battle
with me."

Thorodd struck at him most furiously.  Grettir was tired of it,
so he took hold of him and set him down next to himself, saying:
"I could do what I liked with you; but I have no fear of your
killing me.  I am much more afraid of your grey-headed father,
Snorri the Godi, and of his counsels, which have brought many a
man to his knees.  You should take up tasks which you are able to
accomplish; it is no child's play to fight with me."

When Thorodd saw that there was nothing to be done he quieted
down, and then they parted.  He rode home to Tunga and told his
father of his encounter witb Grettir.  Snorri smiled and said:
"Many a man has a high opinion of himself; but the odds against
you were too great.  While you were aiming blows at him he was
doing what he pleased with you.  But he was wise not to kill you,
for it would not have been my purpose to leave you unavenged.  I
will now rather use my influence on his side if I ever have to do
with his affairs."

Snorri showed his approval of Grettir's action towards Thorodd,
for his counsels were always friendly to Grettir.


CHAPTER LXIX

GRETTIR'S LAST VISIT TO BJARG AND JOURNEY WITH ILLUGI TO DRANGEY

Soon after Thorodd left him Grettir rode North to Bjarg and
remained there in hiding for a time.  His fear of the dark grew
so upon him that he dared go nowhere after dusk.  His mother
offered to keep him there, but said she saw that it would not do
for him because of the feuds which he had throughout the land. 
Grettir said she should not fall into trouble through him, "but,"
he said, "I can no longer live alone even to save my life."

Illugi his brother was then fifteen years old and was a most
goodly young man.  He heard what they were saying.  Grettir told
his mother what Gudmund the Mighty had advised him to do, and
declared he would try to get to Drangey if he could.  Yet, he
said, he could not go there unless he could find some faithful
man to stay with him.  Then Illugi said: "I will go with you,
brother.  I know not whether I shall be a support to you, but I
will be faithful to you and will not run from you so long as you
stand upright.  And I shall know the better how it fares with you
if I am with you."

Grettir answered: "You are such an one amongst men as I most
rejoice in.  And if my mother be not against it I would indeed
that you should go with me."

Asdis then said: "It has now come to this, that I see two
difficulties meeting each other.  It is hard for me to lose
Illugi, but I know that so much may be said for Grettir's
condition that he will find some way out.  And though it is much
for one to bid farewell to both of you, yet I will consent to it
if Grettir's lot is bettered thereby."

Illugi was pleased at her words, for his heart was set upon going
with Grettir.  She gave them plenty of money to take with them
and they made ready for their journey.  Asdis took them along the
road, and before they parted she said: "Go forth now, my sons
twain.  Sad will be your death together, nor may any man escape
that which is destined for him.  I shall see neither of you
again; let one fate befall you both.  I know not what safety you
seek in Drangey, but there shall your bones be laid, and many
will begrudge you your living there.  Beware of treachery; yet
shall you be smitten with weapons, for strange are the dreams
which I have had.  Guard yourselves against witchcraft, for few
things are stronger than the ancient spells."

Thus she spoke and wept much.  Grettir said: "Weep not, my
mother.  It shall be said that you had sons and not daughters if
we are attacked with arms.  Live well, and farewell."

Then they parted.  The two travelled North through the districts
and visited their kinsmen while the autumn passed into winter. 
Then they turned their steps to Skagafjord, then North to
Vatnsskard on to Reykjaskard below Saemundarhlid to Langholt,
reaching Glaumbaer as the day was waning.  Grettir had slung his
hat over his shoulder; so he always went when out of doors
whether the weather was good or bad.  Thence they continued their
journey, and when they had gone a short way they met a man with a
big head, tall and thin and ill clad.  He greeted them and each
asked the other's name.  They told theirs and he said his name
was Thorbjorn.  He was a vagrant, had no mind to work and
swaggered much.  It was the habit of some to make game of him or
fool him.  He became very familiar and told them much gossip
about the district and the people therein.  Grettir was much
amused.  He asked whether they did not want a man to work for
them and said he would much like to go with them.  So much he got
from his talk that they let him join them.  It was very cold and
there was a driving snow-storm.  As the man was so fussy and
talkative they gave him a nickname and called him Glaum.

"The people in Glaumbaer," he said, "were much exercised about
your going without a hat in this weather, and wanted to know
whether you were any the braver for being proof against the cold.

There were two sons of bondis there, men of great distinction;
the shepherd told them to come out and mind the sheep with him,
but they could scarcely get their clothes on for the cold."

Grettir said: "I saw a young man inside the door putting on his
mittens, and another going between the cow-house and the dung-
heap.  Neither of them will frighten me."

Then they went on to Reynines and stayed the night there; then to
the sea-shore to a farm called Reykir where a man, a good farmer,
named Thorvald, lived.  Grettir asked him for shelter and told
him of his intention of going to Drangey.  The bondi said that
men of Skagafjord would not think his a very friendly visit and
drew back.  Then Grettir took the purse of money which his mother
had given him and gave it to the bondi.  The man's brows unbent
when he saw the money and he told three of his servants to take
them out in the night by the moonlight.  From Reykir is the
shortest distance to the island, about one sea-mile.

When they reached the island Grettir thought it looked quite
pleasant; it was all overgrown with grass and had steep cliffs
down to the sea so that no one could get on to it except where
the ladders were.  If the upper ladder was pulled up it was
impossible for any one to get on to the island.  There was also a
large crag full of sea birds in the summer, and there were eighty
sheep in the island belonging to the bondis, mostly rams and
ewes, which were meant for slaughter.

There Grettir quietly settled down.  He had been fifteen or
sixteen years an outlaw, so Sturla the son of Thord has recorded.


CHAPTER LXX

THE PEOPLE OF SKAGAFJORD

When Grettir came to Drangey the following chiefs were in
Skagafjord:

Hjalti lived at Hof in Hjaltadal, the son of Thord, the son of
Hjalti, the son of Thord Skalp.  He was a great chief, very
distinguished and very popular.  His brother was named Thorbjorn
Angle, a big man, strong and hardy and rather quarrelsome.  Thord
their father had married in his old age, and his then wife was
not the mother of these two.  She was very much against her
stepsons, especially Thorbjorn, because he was intractable and
headstrong.  One day when he was playing at "tables", his
stepmother came up and saw that he was playing at "hnettafl";
they played with big peg pieces.  She considered that very lazy
of him and spoke some words to which he answered hastily.  She
took up the piece and struck him on the cheek bone with the peg,
and it glanced into his eye which hung down on his cheek.  He
started up and handled her mercilessly so that she was confined
to her bed and soon afterwards died; they say that she was
pregnant at the time.  After that he became a regular ruffian. 
He took over his property and went first to live in Vidvik.

Halldor the son of Thorgeir, the son of Thord of Hofdi, lived at
Hof in Hofdastrand.  He married Thordis the daughter of Thord,
the sister of Hjalti and Thorbjorn Angle.  Halldor was a worthy
bondi and wealthy.

Bjorn was the name of a man who lived at Haganes in Fljot, a
friend of Halldor of Hof, and the two held together in every
dispute.

Tungu-Steinn dwelt at Steinsstadir.  He was the son of Bjorn, the
son of Ofeig Thinbeard, the son of Crow-Hreidar, to whom Eirik of
Guddal gave Tunga below Skalamyr.  He was a man of renown.

Eirik was the son of Holmgang-Starri, the son of Eirik of Guddal,
the son of Hroald, the son of Geirmund Straightbeard.  He lived
at Hof in Guddal.

All these were men of high rank.  Two brothers dwelt at a place
called Breida in Slettahlid, both named Thord.  They were very
strong men, but peaceable.

All the men now named had a share in Drangey.  It is said that
the island was owned by no fewer than twenty men, and none of
them would part with his share to the others.  The largest share
belonged to the sons of Thord since they were the richest.


CHAPTER LXXI

THE BONDIS CLAIM THEIR PROPERTY IN DRANGEY

Midwinter was passed, and the bondis prepared to bring in their
animals from the island for slaughter.  They manned a boat and
each had a man of his own on board, some two.

When they reached the island they saw men on it moving about. 
They thought it very strange, but supposed that some one had been
wrecked and had gone on shore there.  So they rowed to where the
ladders were.  The people on the shore pulled the ladders up. 
This seemed very strange behaviour and they hailed the men and
asked who they were.  Grettir told his name and those of his
companions.  The bondis asked who had taken them out to the
island.

Grettir answered: "He brought me out who took me here, and had
hands, and was more my friend than yours."

The bondis said: "Let us take our animals and come to the land
with us.  You shall have freely whatever you have taken of our
property."

Grettir said: "That is a good offer; but each of us shall have
that which he has got.  I may tell you at once that hence I go
not, unless I am dead or dragged away; nor will I let go that
which my hands have taken."

The bondis said no more, but thought that most unhappy visitors
had come to Drangey.  They offered money and made many fair
promises, but Grettir refused them all, and so they had to return
home much disgusted, having accomplished nothing.  They told all
the people of the district of the wolves who had come into the
island.  This had come upon them unawares and nothing could be
done.  They talked it over that winter but could think of no way
of getting Grettir out of the island.


CHAPTER LXXII

GRETTIR VISITS THE THING AT HEGRANES

The time passed on until the spring, when men assembled at the
Hegranes Thing.  They came in great numbers from all the
districts under its jurisdiction, and stayed there a long time,
both palavering and merry-making, for there were many who loved
merriment in the country round.

When Grettir heard that everybody had gone to the Thing he laid a
plan with his friends, for he was always on good terms with those
who were nearest to him, and for them he spared nothing which he
was able to get.  He said he would go to the land to get supplies
and that Illugi and Glaum should remain behind.  Illugi thought
it very imprudent but he let Grettir have his way.  He told them
to guard the ladder well since everything depended upon that. 
Then he went to the land and obtained what he wanted.  He kept
his disguise wherever he went and no one knew that he had come. 
He heard of the festivities that were going on at the Thing and
was curious to see them, so he put on some old clothes that were
rather shabby and arrived just as they were going from the
Logretta home to their booths.  Some of the young men were
talking about the weather, said it was good and fair, and that it
would be a good thing to have some games and wrestling; they
thought it a good proposal.  So they sat down in front of their
booths.  The foremost men in the games were the sons of Thord. 
Thorbjorn Angle was very uppish and was arranging everything
himself for the sports.  Every one had to do as he bade, and he
took them each by the shoulders and pushed them into the field. 
The wrestling was begun by the less strong ones in pairs, and
there was great sport.  When most of them had wrestled except the
strongest, there was much talk as to who should tackle the two
Thords mentioned above, and there was no one who would do it. 
They went round inviting men to wrestle, but the more they asked
the more their invitation was declined.  Thorbjorn Angle looked
round and saw a big man sitting there, but could not clearly see
his face.  He seized hold of him and gave a violent tug, but the
man sat still and did not move.

Thorbjorn said: "Nobody has held so firm against me to-day as
you.  But who is this fellow?"

"My name is Gest."

Thorbjorn said: "You will be wanting to play with us.  You are a
welcome Guest."

"Things may change quickly," he said.  "I cannot join in your
games for I have no knowledge of them."

Many of them said that they would take it kindly of him if he, a
stranger, would play a little with the men.  He asked what they
wanted him to do, and they asked him to wrestle with some one. 
He said he had given up wrestling, though he once used to take
pleasure in it.  As he did not directly refuse they pressed him
all the more.

"Well," he said, "if you want to drag me in you must do one thing
for me and grant me peace here at the Thing until I reach my
home."

They all shouted and said they would gladly do that.  The man who
was foremost in urging that peace should be given was one Haf the
son of Thorarin, the son of Haf, the son of Thord Knapp, who had
settled in the land between Stifla in Fljot and Tungua.  He lived
at Knappsstad and was a man of many words.  He spoke in favour of
the peace with great authority and said:

"Hereby do I declare PEACE between all men, in particular between
this man here seated who is named Gest and all Godord's men, full
bondis, all men of war and bearers of arms, all other men of this
district of the Hegranes Thing whencesoever they have come, both
named and unnamed.  I declare PEACE and full Immunity in behoof
of this newcomer to us unknown, Gest yclept, for the practice of
games, wrestling and all kinds of sport, while abiding here, and
during his journey home, whether he sail or whether he travel,
whether by land or whether by sea.  He shall have PEACE in all
places, named and unnamed, for such time as he needeth to reach
his home in safety, by our faith confirmed.  And I establish this
PEACE on the part of ourselves and of our kinsmen, our friends
and belongings, alike of women and of men, bondsmen and thralls,
youths and adults.  Be there any truce-breaker who shall violate
this PEACE and defile this faith, so be he rejected of God and
expelled from the community of righteous men; be he cast out from
Heaven and from the fellowship of the holy; let him have no part
amongst mankind and become an outcast from society.  A vagabond
he shall be and a wolf in places where Christians pray and where
heathen worship, where fire burneth, where the earth bringeth
forth, where the child lispeth the name of mother, where the
mother beareth a son, where men kindle fire, where the ship
saileth, where shields blink, sun shineth, snow lieth, Finn
glideth, fir-tree groweth, falcon flieth the live-long day and
the fair wind bloweth straight under both her wings, where Heaven
rolleth and earth is tilled, where the breezes waft mists to the
sea, where corn is sown.  Far shall he dwell from church and
Christian men, from the sons of the heathen, from house and cave
and from every home, in the torments of Hel.  At PEACE we shall
be, in concord together, each with other in friendly mind,
wherever we meet, on mountain or strand, on ship or on snow-
shoes, on plains or on glaciers, at sea or on horseback, as
friends meet in the water, or brothers by the way, each at PEACE
with other, as son with father, or father with son, in all our
dealings.

"Our hands we lay together, all and every to hold well the PEACE
and the words we have spoken in this our faith, in the presence
of God and of holy men, of all who hear my words and here are
present."

Many said that a great word had been spoken.  Gest said: "You
have declared and spoken well; if you go not back upon it, I will
not delay to show that of which I am capable."

Then he cast off his hood and after that all his upper garments. 
Each looked at the other and woe spread over their lips; for they
knew that it was Grettir who had come to them, by his excelling
all other men in stature and vigour.  All were silent and Haf
looked foolish.  The men of the district went two and two
together, each blaming the other, and most of all blaming him who
had declared the peace.  Then Grettir said: "Speak plainly to me
and declare what is in your minds, for I will not sit here long
without my clothes.  You have more at stake than I have, whether
you hold the peace or not."

They answered little and sat themselves down.  The sons of Thord
and their brother-in-law Halldor then talked together.  Some
wished to uphold the peace and some not.  Each nodded to the
other.  Then Grettir spoke a verse:

     "Many a man is filled with doubt.
     A twofold mask has the prover of shields.
     The skilful tongue is put to shame.
     They doubt if they shall hold the troth."

Then said Tungu-Steinn: "Think you so, Grettir?  Which then will
the chieftains do?  But true it is that you excel all men in
courage.  See you not how they are putting their noses together?"

Grettir then said:

     "Together they all their noses laid;
     they wagged their beards in close converse.
     They talked with each other by two and two,
     regretting the peace they afore declared."

Then said Hjalti the son of Thord: "It shall not be so; we will
hold the peace with you although our minds have altered.  I would
not that men should have the example of our having broken the
peace which we ourselves gave and declared.  Grettir shall depart
unhindered whithersoever he will, and shall have peace till such
time as he reach his home from this journey.  And then this truce
shall have expired whatever happen with us."  They all thanked
him for his speech, and thought he had acted as a chieftain
should under such circumstances.  Thorbjorn Angle was silent. 
Then it was proposed that one or the other of the Thords should
close with Grettir, and he said that they might do as they chose.

One of the two brothers Thord then came forward.  Grettir stood
upright before him and Thord went for him with all his might, but
Grettir never moved from his place.  Then Grettir stretched over
across his back and seizing his breeches tripped up his foot and
cast him backwards over his head so that he fell heavily upon his
shoulders.  Then the people said that both the brothers should
tackle him together, and they did so.  There arose a mighty
tussle, each in turn having the advantage, although Grettir
always had one of them down.  Now one, now the other was brought
to his knees or met with a reverse.  So fiercely they gripped
that all of them were bruised and bloody.  Everybody thought it
splendid sport, and when they ceased thanked them for their
wrestling.  Those that were sitting near judged that the two
together were no stronger than Grettir alone, although each had
the strength of two strong men.  They were so equal that when
they strove together neither gained the advantage.  Grettir did
not stay long at the Thing.  The bondis asked him to give up the
island, but this he refused to do, and they accomplished nothing.

Grettir returned to Drangey where Illugi rejoiced much at seeing
him again.  They stayed there in peace and Grettir told them of
his journeys; so the summer passed.  All thought the men of
Skagafjord had acted most honourably in upholding their peace,
and from this may be seen what trusty men lived in those days,
after all that Grettir had done against them.  The less wealthy
ones among the bondis began to talk amongst themselves and say
that there was little profit in keeping a small share of the
island, and now offered to sell their holdings to the sons of
Thord, but Hjalti said he did not want to buy them.  The bondis
stipulated that any one who wanted to buy a share should either
kill Grettir or get him away.  Thorbjorn Angle said that he was
ready to take the lead, and would spare no pains to attack
Grettir if they would pay him for it.  Hjalti his brother
resigned to him his share of the island because Thorbjorn was the
more violent and was unpopular.  Several other bondis did the
same, so that Thorbjorn Angle got a large part of the island at a
small price, but he bound himself to get Grettir away.


CHAPTER LXXIII

VISIT OF THORBJORN ANGLE TO DRANGEY

At the end of the summer Thorbjorn Angle went with a boat fully
manned to Drangey.  Grettir and his party came forward on the
cliff and they talked together.  Thorbjorn begged Grettir to do
so much for his asking as to quit the island.  Grettir said there
was not much hope of that.  Thorbjorn said: "It may be that I can
give you some assistance which will make it worth your while to
do this.  Many of the bondis have now given up the shares which
they had in the island to me."

Grettir said: "Now for the very reason that you have just told
me, because you own the greater part of the island, I am
determined never to go hence.  We may now divide the cabbage.  It
is true that I thought it irksome to have the whole of Skagafjord
against me, but now neither need spare the other, since neither
is suffocated with the love of his fellows.  You may as well put
off your journeys hither, for the matter is settled so far as I
am concerned."

"All abide their time," he said, "and you abide evil."

"I must risk that," he said.  And so they parted.  Thorbjorn
returned home again.


CHAPTER LXXIV

THE FIRE GOES OUT IN DRANGEY

Grettir had, it is said, been two years in Drangey, and they had
slaughtered nearly all the sheep.  One ram, it is told, they
allowed to live; it was grey below and had large horns.  They had
much sport with it, for it was very tame and would stand outside
and follow them wherever they went.  It came to the hut in the
evening and rubbed its horns against the door.  They lived very
comfortably, having plenty to eat from the birds on the island
and their eggs, nor had they much trouble in gathering wood
for fire.  Grettir always employed the man to collect the drift,
and there were often logs cast ashore there which he brought home
for fuel.  The brothers had no need to work beyond going to the
cliffs, which they did whenever they chose.  The thrall began to
get very slack at his work; he grumbled much and was less careful
than before.  It was his duty to mind the fire every night, and
Grettir bade him be very careful of it as they had no boat with
them.  One night it came to pass that the fire went out.  Grettir
was very angry and said it would only be right that Glaum should
have a hiding.  The thrall said he had a very poor life of it to
have to lie there in exile and be ill-treated and beaten if
anything went wrong.  Grettir asked Illugi what was to be done,
and he said he could think of nothing else but to wait until a
ship brought them some fire.

Grettir said that would be a very doubtful chance to wait for. 
"I will venture it," he said, "and see whether I can reach the
land."

"That is a desperate measure," said Illugi.  "We shall be done
for if you miscarry."

"I shall not drown in the channel," he said.  "I shall trust the
thrall less in future since he has failed in a matter of such
moment to us."

The shortest passage from the island to the mainland is one
sea-mile.


CHAPTER LXXV

GRETTIR SWIMS TO THE MAINLAND FOR FIRE

Grettir then prepared for his swim.  He wore a cloak of coarse
material with breeches and had his fingers webbed.  The weather
was fine; he left the island towards the evening.  Illugi thought
his journey was hopeless.  Grettir had the current with him and
it was calm as he swam towards the fjord.  He smote the water
bravely and reached Reykjanes after sunset.  He went into the
settlement at Reykir, bathed in the night in a warm spring, and
then entered the hall, where it was very hot and a little smoky
from the fire which had been burning there all day.  He was very
tired and slept soundly, lying on right into the day.  When it
was a little way on in the morning the servants rose, and the
first to enter the room were two women, the maid with the bondi's
daughter.  Grettir was asleep, and his clothes had all fallen off
on to the floor.  They saw a man lying there and recognised him. 
The maid said:

"As I wish for salvation, sister, here is Grettir the son of
Asmund come.  He really is large about the upper part of his
body, and is lying bare.  But he seems to me unusually small
below.  It is not at all in keeping with the rest of him."

The bondi's daughter said: "How can you let your tongue run on
so?  You are more than half a fool!  Hold your tongue!"

"I really cannot be silent, my dear sister," said the maid; "I
would not have believed it if any one had told me."

Then she went up to him to look more closely, and kept running
back to the bondi's daughter and laughing.  Grettir heard what
she said, sprang up and chased her down the room.  When he had
caught her he spoke a verse:

(VERSE MISSING IN MANUSCRIPT)

Soon afterwards Grettir went to the bondi Thorvald, told him his
difficulty and asked him to take him out to the island again,
which he did, lending him a ship and taking him over.  Grettir
thanked him for his courtesy.  When it became known that Grettir
had swum a sea-mile, every one thought his courage extraordinary
both on sea and on land.  The men of Skagafjord blamed Thorbjorn
Angle much for not having ridded Drangey of Grettir, and all
wanted their shares back again.  That did not suit him and he
asked them to have patience.


CHAPTER LXXVI

ADVENTURE OF HAERING IN DRANGEY

That summer a ship came to Gonguskardsos, on board of which was a
man named Haering.  He was a young man and very active; he could
climb any cliff.  He went to visit Thorbjorn Angle and stayed
there into the autumn.  He pressed Thorbjorn much to take him to
Drangey, that he might see whether the cliff was so high that he
could not get up there.  Thorbjorn said it should not be for
nothing if he succeeded in getting up on to the island and either
killing or wounding Grettir; he made it appear attractive as a
task for Haering to undertake.

One day they went to Drangey and he put the Easterner ashore in a
certain place, telling him not to let himself be seen if he got
to the top.  Then they set up the ladder and began a conversation
with Grettir's people.  Thorbjorn asked him whether he would not
leave the island.  He said there was nothing on which he was so
determined.

"You have played much with us," said Thorbjorn, "and we do not
seem likely to have our revenge, but you have not much fear for
yourself."

Thus they disputed for long, but came to no agreement.

We have now to tell of Haering.  He climbed all about on the
cliffs and got to the top in a place which no other man ever
reached before or since.  On reaching the top he saw the two
brothers standing with their backs turned to him.  He hoped in a
short time to win money and glory from both.  They had no inkling
of his being there, and thought that nobody could get up except
where the ladders were.  Grettir was occupied with Thorbjorn's
men, and there was no lack of derisive words on both sides.  Then
Illugi looked round and saw a man coming towards them, already
quite close.  He said: "Here is a man coming towards us with his
axe in the air; he has a rather hostile appearance."  "You deal
with him," said Grettir, "while I look after the ladder."  Illugi
then advanced against the Easterner, who on seeing him turned and
ran about all over the island.  Illugi chased him to the furthest
end of the island; on reaching the edge he leaped down and broke
every bone in his body; thus his life ended.  The place where he
perished was afterwards called Haering's leap.  Illugi returned
and Grettir asked him how he had parted with his man.

"He would not trust me to manage for him," he said.  "He broke
his neck over the cliff.  The bondis may pray for him as for a
dead man."

When Angle heard that he told his men to shove off.  "I have now
been twice to meet Grettir," he said.  "I may come a third time,
and if then I return no wiser than I am now, it is likely that
they may stay in Drangey, so far as I am concerned.  But methinks
Grettir will not be there so long in the future as he has been in
the past."

They then returned home and this journey seemed even worse than
the one before.  Grettir stayed in Drangey and saw no more of
Thorbjorn that winter.  Skapti the Lawman died during the winter,
whereby Grettir suffered a great loss, for he had promised to
press for a removal of his sentence when he had been twenty years
an outlaw, and the events just related were in the nineteenth
year.  In the spring died Snorri the Godi, and much more happened
during this winter season which does not belong to our saga.


CHAPTER LXXVII

GRETTIR'S CASE BEFORE THE ALL-THING

That summer at the All-Thing Grettir's friends spoke much about
his outlawry, and some held that his term was fulfilled when he
had completed any portion of the twentieth year.  This was
disputed by the opposite party, who declared that he had
committed many acts deserving of outlawry since, and that,
therefore, his sentence ought to be all the longer.  A new Lawman
had been appointed, Steinn the son of Thorgest, the son of Steinn
the Far-traveller, the son of Thorir Autumn-mist.  The mother of
Steinn the Lawman was Arnora, the daughter of Thord the Yeller. 
He was a wise man, and was asked for his opinion.  He told them
to make a search to find out whether this was the twentieth year
of his outlawry, and they did so.  Then Thorir of Gard went to
work to put every possible difficulty in the way, and found out
that Grettir had spent one year of the time in Iceland, during
which he must be held to have been free of his outlawry. 
Consequently it had only lasted nineteen years.

The Lawman declared that no man could be outlawed for longer than
twenty years in all, even though he committed an outlaw's acts
during that time.  But before that he would allow no man to be
freed.

Thus the endeavour to remove his sentence broke down for the
moment, but there seemed a certainty of his being freed in the
following summer.  The men of Skagafjord were little pleased at
the prospect of Grettir being freed, and they told Thorbjorn
Angle that he must do one of the two, resign his holding in the
island or kill Grettir.  He was in great straits, for he saw no
way of killing Grettir, and yet he wanted to keep the island.  He
tried everything he could think of to get the better of Grettir
by force or by fraud or in any other way that he could.


CHAPTER LXXVIII

THORBJORN'S FOSTER-MOTHER

Thorbjorn Angle had a foster-mother named Thurid.  She was very
old and of little use to mankind, but she had been very skilled
in witchcraft and magic when she was young and the people were
heathen.  Now she seemed to have lost it all.  Still, although
the land was Christian, many sparks of heathendom remained.  It
was not forbidden by the law of the land to sacrifice or perform
other heathen rites in private; only the one who performed them
openly was sentenced to the minor exile.  Now it happened to many
as it is said: The hand turns to its wonted skill, and that which
we have learned in youth is always most familiar to us.  So
Thorbjorn Angle, baffled in all his plans, turned for help to the
quarter where it would have been least looked for most people,
namely, to his foster-mother, and asked her what she could do for
him.

She replied, "Now it seems to me to have come to this, as the
saying is: Many go to the goat-house to get wool.  What would I
less than to think myself above the other men of the country, and
then to be as nothing when it comes to the trial?  I see not that
it fares worse with me than with you, even though I scarce rise
from my bed.  If you will have my counsel then I must have my way
in all that is done."

He consented, and said that she had long given him counsel for
his good.  The "double month" of the summer was now approaching. 
One fine day the old woman said to Angle: "The weather is now
calm and bright; I will that you go to Drangey and pick a quarrel
with Grettir.  I will go with you and learn what caution is in
his words.  I shall have some surety when I see how far they are
prospering, and then I will speak over them such words as I
please."

Angle said: "Let us not go to Drangey.  It is always worse in my
mind when I leave that place than when I arrive."

The woman said: "I will not help you if you will not let me do as
I like."

"Far be that from me, my foster-mother.  I have said that I will
go there a third time, that something may come of it for us."

"You may venture it," she said, "much labour will you have before
Grettir is laid in the earth; often your lot will be doubtful and
hard will it go with you before it is finished.  And yet you are
so bound that somehow you must get yourself out of it."

Then Thorbjorn Angle had a ten-oared boat manned and went on
board with eleven men.  The woman was with them and they rowed
out to Drangey.  When the brothers saw them coming they came
forward to the ladder and began once more to talk about their
case.  Thorbjorn said he had come once more to hear their answer
whether Grettir would leave the place.  He said he would treat
the destruction of his property and Grettir's stay there as a
light thing, provided they parted in peace.  Grettir said he had
no intention of coming to any terms about his going away.  "I
have often told you," he said, "that there is no use in talking
to me about it.  You may do whatever you please; I mean to stay
here and abide what happens."

Thorbjorn saw that his end would not be gained this time, and
said: "I knew very well with what men of Hel I had to do.  It is
most likely that some days will pass before I come here again."

"It would not hurt me if you never came at all," said Grettir.

The woman was lying in the stern sheets covered up with clothes. 
Then she began to stir and said:

"These men are brave and unfortunate; there is much difference
between you; you offer them good and they refuse everything. 
There are few more certain tokens of evil than not to know how to
accept the good.  Now I say this of you, Grettir, that you be
deprived of health, of all good luck and fortune, of all
protection and counsel, ever the more the longer you live.  I
wish that your days may be less happy in the future than they
have been in the past."

When Grettir heard that he started violently and said: "What
fiend is that in the ship with them?"

Illugi said: "I think that must be the old woman, Thorbjorn's
foster-mother."

"Curse the hag!" he said.  "I could have thought of nothing
worse!  Nothing that was ever said startled me more than her
words, and I know that some evil will befall me from her and her
spells.  She shall have something to remind her of her visit
here."

Then he took up an enormous stone and threw it down into the
boat.  It fell into the heap of clothes.  Thorbjorn had not
thought that any man could throw so far.  A loud scream was
heard, for the stone had struck her thigh and broken it.

Illugi said: "I wish you had not done that."

"Do not blame me for it," said Grettir.  "I fear it has been just
too little.  One old woman would not have been too great a price
for us two."

"How will she pay for us?  That will be a small sum for the pair
of us."

Thorbjorn then returned home; no greeting passed between them
when he left.  He spoke to the old woman and said: "It has
happened as I expected.  Little credit has the journey to the
island brought you.  You have been injured for the rest of your
life, and we have no more honour than we had before; we have to
endure unatoned one insult after another."

She answered: "This is the beginning of their destruction; I say
that from this time onwards they will go downwards.  I care not
whether I live or not, if I do not have vengeance for the injury
they have done me."

"You seem to be in high spirits, foster-mother," he said.  Then
they arrived home.  The woman lay in bed for nearly a month
before her leg was set and she was able to walk again.  Men
laughed much over the journey of Thorbjorn and the old woman. 
Little luck had come from the meetings with Grettir, first at the
peace declaration at the Thing, next when Haering was killed, and
now the third time when the woman's thigh was broken, while
nothing had been done on their side.  Thorbjorn Angle suffered
much from their talk.


CHAPTER LXXIX

THE SPELL TAKES EFFECT

The autumn passed and but three weeks remained till the winter. 
The old woman asked to be driven to the sea-shore.  Thorbjorn
asked what she was going to do.

"A small thing only," she said, "yet maybe the signal of greater
things to come."

They did as she asked them.  When they reached the shore she
hobbled on by the sea as if directed to a spot where lay a great
stump of a tree as large as a man could bear on his shoulder. 
She looked at it and bade them turn it over before her; the other
side looked as if it had been burned and smoothed.  She had a
small flat surface cut on its smooth side; then she took a knife,
cut runes upon it, reddened them with her blood and muttered some
spells over it.  After that she walked backwards against the sun
round it, and spoke many potent words.  Then she made them push
the tree into the sea, and said it should go to Drangey and that
Grettir should suffer hurt from it.  Then she went back to
Vidvik.  Thorbjorn said he did not know what would come of it. 
The woman said he would know more clearly some day.  The wind was
towards the land up the fjord, but the woman's stump drifted
against the wind, and not more slowly than would have been
expected.

Grettir was sitting in Drangey with his companions very
comfortably, as has been told.  On the day following that on
which the old woman had cast her spells upon the tree they went
down from the hill to look for firewood.  When they got to the
western side of the island they found a great stump stranded
there.

"Here is a fine log for fuel," cried Illugi, "let us carry it
home."  Grettir gave it a kick with his foot and said: "An ill
tree and ill sent.  We must find other wood for the fire."

He pushed it out into the sea and told Illugi to beware of
carrying it home, for it was sent for their destruction.  Then
they returned to their hut and said nothing about the tree to the
thrall.  The next day they found the tree again, nearer to the
ladder than on the day before.  Grettir put it back into the sea
and said he would never carry it home.  That night passed and
dirty weather set in with rain, so that they did not care to go
out and told Glaum to fetch fuel.  He grumbled very much and
declared it was cruel to make him plague himself to death in
every kind of weather.  He descended the ladder and found there
the woman's log.  He thought himself lucky, laboured home with it
to the hut and threw it down with a great noise which Grettir
heard.

"Glaum has got something; I must go out and see what it is," he
said, and went out, taking his wood-cutting axe with him.

"Let your cutting up of it be no worse than my carrying of it
home!" said Glaum.

Grettir was irritated with the thrall; he used his axe with both
hands and did not notice what tree it was.  Directly the axe
touched the tree it turned flat and glanced off into Grettir's
right leg.  It entered above his right knee and pierced to the
bone, making a severe wound.  Grettir turned to the tree and
said: "He who meant me evil has prevailed; it will not end with
this.  This is the very log which I twice rejected.  Two
disasters have you now brought about, Glaum; first you let
our fire go out, and now you have brought in this tree of
ill-fortune.  A third mistake will be the death of you and of us
all."

Illugi then bound the wound.  It bled little; Grettir slept well
that night and three days passed without its paining him.  When
they opened the bandages the flesh had grown together and the
wound was almost healed.  Illugi said: "I do not think that you
will suffer very long with this wound."

"That would be well," said Grettir; "it has happened strangely
however it ends; but my mind tells me otherwise."


CHAPTER LXXX

THE SPELL CONTINUES TO WORK

One evening they all went to bed, and about midnight Grettir
began to toss about.  Illugi asked him why he was so restless. 
Grettir said his leg was hurting him and he thought there must be
some change in its appearance.  They fetched a light, unbound the
wound and found it swollen and blue as coal.  It had opened again
and was much worse than at first.  He had much pain after that
and could not keep quiet, nor would any sleep come to his eyes.

Grettir said: "We must be prepared for it.  This illness of mine
is not for nothing; there is witchcraft in it.  The old woman has
meant to punish me for the stone which I threw at her."  Illugi
said: "I told you that no good would come of that old woman."

"It will be all the same in the end," said Grettir, and spoke a
verse:

     "Often when men have threatened my life
     I have known to defend it against the foe:
     but now 'tis a woman has done me to death.
     Truly the spells of the wicked are mighty."

"Now we must be on the watch; Thorbjorn Angle will not leave it
to end here.  You, Glaum, must in future guard the ladder every
day and pull it up in the evening.  Do this trustily, for much
depends thereon.  If you betray us your end will be a short one."

Glaum promised most faithfully.  The weather now became severe. 
A north-easterly wind set in and it was very cold.  Every evening
Grettir asked if the ladder was drawn in.

"Are we now to look for men?" said Glaum.  "Is any man so anxious
to take your life that he will lose his own for it?  This weather
is much worse than impossible.  Your warlike mood seems to have
left you utterly if you think that everything is coming to kill
you."

"You will always bear yourself worse than either of us," said
Grettir, "whatever happens.  But now you must mind the ladder
however unwilling you may be."

They drove him out every morning, much to his disgust.  The pain
of the wound increased, and the whole leg was swollen; the thigh
began to fester both above and below the wound, which spread all
round, and Grettir thought he was likely to die.  Illugi sat with
him night and day, paying no heed to anything else.  They were
now in the second week of his illness.


CHAPTER LXXXI

THORBJORN AGAIN VISITS DRANGEY

Thorbjorn Angle was now at home in Vidvik, much put out at not
having been able to overcome Grettir.  When about a week had
passed from the day when the old woman had bewitched the log,
she came to speak with Thorbjorn and asked whether he did not
mean to visit Grettir.  He said there was nothing about which he
was more determined.

"But do you wish to meet him, foster-mother?" he asked.

"I have no intention of meeting him," she said; "I have sent him
my greeting, which I expect he has received.  But I advise you to
set off at once and go quickly to see him, otherwise it will not
be your fate to overcome him."

He replied: "I have made so many inglorious journeys there that
I am not going again.  This weather is reason enough; it would
not be possible, however pressing it were."

"You are indeed without counsel if you see not through these
wiles.  Now, I will advise you.  First go and collect men; ride
to your brother-in-law Halldor in Hof and get help from him.  Is
it too wild a thing to suppose that I may have to do with this
breeze that is now playing?"

Thorbjorn thought it might be that the woman saw further than he
supposed, so he sent through the country for men.  Answer came
very quickly that none of those who had given up their shares
would do anything to help him.  They said that both the island
and the Grettir affair were Thorbjorn's.  Tungu-Steinn gave him
two men, Hjalti his brother three, Eirik in Guddal sent him one. 
Of his own he had six.  These twelve rode out from Vidvik to Hof,
where Halldor invited them to stay and asked their news. 
Thorbjorn told him everything fully.  Halldor asked who had done
it all; he said his foster-mother had urged him much.

"That will lead to no good.  She is a sorceress, and sorcery is
now forbidden."

"I cannot overlook everything," said Thorbjorn; "I am determined
that it shall now be brought to an end somehow.  But how shall I
go to work to get on to the island?"

"It seems to me," said Halldor, "that you are relying upon
something, but I know not whether it is anything good.  If you
want to accomplish anything go out to my friend Bjorn in Haganes
in Fljot.  He has a good boat; ask him from me to lend it to you,
and then you will be able to sail on to Drangey.  It seems to me
that if you find Grettir well and hearty your journey will have
been in vain.  One thing know for certain: do not slay him in
open fight, for there are enough men to avenge him.  Do not slay
Illugi if you can help it.  I fear that my counsel may not appear
altogether Christian."

Halldor then gave him six men; one was named Kar, another
Thorleif, the third Brand.  The names of the others are not
mentioned.

These eighteen men then went to Fljot, reached Haganes, and gave
Halldor's message to Bjorn.  He said it was his duty to do it for
Halldor's sake, but that he was under no obligation to Thorbjorn.

He said it was an insane journey to make, and tried hard to
dissuade them.  They answered that they could not turn back, so
they went down to the sea and launched the boat, which was ready
with all her gear in the boat-house.  Then they made ready to
sail.  All those who were standing on the shore thought it
impossible to cross.  They hoisted the sail and the boat was soon
under way, far out in the fjord.  When they got right out to sea
the weather quieted and was no longer too heavy.  In the evening
as it was getting dark they reached Drangey.


CHAPTER LXXXII

THE LAST BATTLE -- DEATH OF GRETTIR AND ILLUGI

It has now to be told how Grettir became so ill that he could not
stand on his feet.  Illugi sat with him and Glaum had to hold
watch.  He still continued to object, and said they might think
their lives were going to fall out of them, but there was no
reason for it.  He went out, but most unwillingly.  When he came
to the ladder he said to himself that there was no need to draw
it up.  He felt very sleepy, lay down and slept all day, and did
not wake until Thorbjorn reached the island.  They saw then that
the ladder was not drawn up.  Thorbjorn said: "The situation has
changed from what it used to be; there are no men moving about,
and the ladder is in its place.  It may be that more will come of
our journey than we expected at first.  Now let us go to the hut
and not let our courage slacken.  If they are well we may know
for certain that there will be need for each to do his very
best."

They went up the ladder, looked round and saw close to the ascent
a man lying and snoring aloud.  Thorbjorn recognised Glaum, went
up to the rascal and told him to wake up, striking his ear with
the hilt of his sword and saying: "Truly he is in a bad case
whose life is entrusted to your keeping."

Glaum looked up and said: "They are going on as usual.  Do you
think my freedom such a great thing while I am lying here in the
cold?"

Angle said: "Have you lost your wits?  Don't you see that your
enemies are upon you and about to kill you all?"

Glaum said nothing, but on recognising the men cried out as loud
as he could.

"Do one thing or the other," said Angle; "either be silent this
moment and tell me all about your household, or be killed."

Glaum was as silent as if he had been dipped in water.

Thorbjorn said: "Are the brothers in the hut?  Why are they not
about?"

"That would not be so easy," said Glaum, "for Grettir is sick and
nigh to death and Illugi is sitting with him."

Thorbjorn asked about his condition, and what had happened.  Then
Glaum told him all about Grettir's wound.

Angle laughed and said: "True is the ancient saying that Old
friends are the last to break away, and also this, that It is ill
to have a thrall for your friend -- such a one as you, Glaum! 
You have shamefully betrayed your liege lord, though there was
little good in him."

Then the others cast reproaches at him for his villainy; they
beat him almost helpless and left him lying there.  Then they
went on to the hut and knocked violently at the door.

Illugi said: "Greybelly (1) is knocking at the door, brother."

"He is knocking rather loud," said Grettir; "most unmercifully."
Then the door broke in pieces.  Illugi rushed to his arms and
defended the door so that they could not get in.  They assailed
it long, but could get nothing in but the points of their spears,
all of which Illugi severed from their shafts.  Seeing that they
could do nothing, they sprang on to the roof and began to break
it in.  Then Grettir got on to his feet, seized a spear and
thrust it between the rafters.  It struck Kar, Halldor's man from
Hof, and went right through him.  Angle told them to go to work
warily and be careful of themselves.  "We shall only overcome
them," he said, "if we act with caution."

Then they laid open the end of one of the timbers and bore upon
it until it broke.  Grettir was unable to rise from his knees,
but he seized the sword Karsnaut at the moment when they all
sprang in from the roof, and a mighty fray began.  Grettir struck
with his sword at Vikar, a man of Hjalti the son of Thord,
reaching his left shoulder as he sprang from the roof.  It passed
across his shoulder, out under his right arm, and cut him right
in two.  His body fell in two parts on the top of Grettir and
prevented him from recovering his sword as quickly as he wished,
so that Thorbjorn Angle was able to wound him severely between
the shoulders.  Grettir said: "Bare is his back who has no
brother!"

Illugi threw his shield before Grettir and defended him so
valiantly that all men praised his prowess.

Grettir said to Angle: "Who showed you the way to the island?"

"Christ showed us the way," he said.

"I guess," said Grettir, "that it was the wicked old woman, your
foster-mother, who showed you; hers were the counsels that you
relied upon."

"It shall now be all the same to you," said Angle, "upon whom I
relied."

They returned to the attack; Illugi defended himself and Grettir
courageously, but Grettir was unfit for fighting, partly from his
wounds, partly from his illness.  Angle then ordered them to bear
Illugi down with their shields, saying he had never met with his
like amongst older men than he.  They did so, and pressed upon
him with a wall of armour against which resistance was
impossible.  They took him prisoner and kept him.  He had wounded
most of those who were attacking him and killed three.  Then they
went for Grettir, who had fallen forward on his face.  There was
no resistance in him for he was already dead from his wounded
leg; his thigh was all mortified up to the rectum.  Many more
wounds they gave him, but little or no blood flowed.

When they thought he was quite dead Angle took hold of his sword,
saying he had borne it long enough, but Grettir's fingers were so
tightly locked around the hilt that he could not loosen them. 
Many tried before they gave it up, eight of them in turn, but all
failed.  Angle then said: "Why should we spare a forest-man?  Lay
his hand upon the log."

They did so, and he hewed off the hand at the wrist.  Then the
fingers straightened and were loosed from the hilt.  Angle took
his sword in both hands and hewed at Grettir's head.  So mighty
was the blow that the sword could not hold against it, and a
piece was broken out of the edge.  When asked why he spoilt a
good weapon, he replied: "It will be more easily known if there
be any question."

They said this was unnecessary, as the man was dead before.  "I
will do more," he said, and struck two or three blows at
Grettir's neck before he took off his head.  Then he said:

"Now I know for certain that Grettir is dead; a great man of war
have we laid even with the earth.  We will take his head with us,
for I have no wish to lose the money which was put upon it. 
There shall not be any doubt that it was I who slew Grettir."

They said he might do as he pleased, but they felt much
disgusted, and thought his conduct contemptible.

Then Angle said to Illugi: "It is a great pity that a man so
valiant as you should have committed such a folly as to cast in
your lot with this outlaw and follow his evil ways, at last to
die unatoned."

Illugi answered: "When the All-Thing is over next summer you
shall know who are outlawed.  Neither you nor the woman, your
foster-mother, shall judge this case, for it is your spells and
sorcery that have killed Grettir, though you bore your iron
weapons against him when he was at the door of death.  Many a
base deed did you do over and above your witchcraft."

Angle said: "You speak bravely, but it shall not be so.  I will
show how I value you by sparing your life if you will swear by
your honour to take no vengeance upon any person who has been
with us on this occasion."

"I might have thought of it," he said, "if Grettir had been able
to defend himself or if you had killed him in honourable battle. 
But now you need not hope that I will try to save my life by
becoming a poltroon like you.  I tell you at once that if I live
no man shall be more burdensome to you than I.  Long will it be
before I forget how you have dealt with Grettir; far sooner will
I choose to die."

Then Thorbjorn consulted with his companions whether they should
allow Illugi to live.  They said he should decide their doings
himself, as he was the leader of the expedition.  Angle said he
was not going to have a man threatening his head who would not
promise to hold faith.  When Illugi knew that they intended to
slay him he laughed and said: "Now you have resolved upon that
which was nearest to my heart."

When the day broke they led him to the eastern side of the island
and there slew him.  All praised his courage, and said there was
no man of his years who was like him.  They buried both the
brothers in the island, but took Grettir's head with all weapons
and clothes which had any value away with them.  His good sword
Angle would not allow to come amongst the spoils for division,
but bore it long himself.  They took Glaum with them, still
complaining and resisting.  The weather had calmed down in the
night, and in the morning they rowed to the mainland.  Angle
sailed for the most convenient place, and sent the ship on to
Bjorn.  When they came near to Osland, Glaum became so
obstreperous that they refused to carry him any further and slew
him there where he was, crying as loud as he could until he was
killed.  Angle went home to Vidvik and considered that on this
journey he had been successful.  They laid Grettir's head in salt
and put it for the winter in the out-house called Grettisbur in
Vidvik.  Angle was much blamed for this affair when men came to
know that Grettir had been overcome by sorcery.  He remained
quietly at home till after Yule.  Then he went to seek Thorir in
Gard and told him of the slayings, adding that he considered that
he had a right to the money which had been put on Grettir's head.

Thorir said that he would not deny that he had brought about
Grettir's sentence.  "I have often suffered wrong from him; but I
would not to take his life have become an evil-doer as you have
done.  I will not pay the money to you, for you seem to me as one
who will be doomed to death for magic and witchcraft."

Angle said: "I think it is much more avarice and meanness on your
part than any scruples about the way in which Grettir was
killed."

Thorir said there was an easy way of settling it between them;
they need only wait for the All-Thing and accept what seemed
right to the Lawman.  They then parted with nothing but ill-
feeling between Thorir and Thorbjorn Angle.

CHAPTER LXXXIII

THORBJORN VISITS GRETTIR'S MOTHER AT BJARG

The kinsmen of Grettir and Illugi were deeply grieved when they
heard of their death.  They held that Angle had done a dastardly
deed in slaying a man at the point of death, and they also
accused him of practising sorcery.  They applied to the most
learned men, and Angle's case was ill-spoken of.

Four weeks after the beginning of summer he rode Westwards to
Midfjord.  When Asdis heard of his being in the neighbourhood she
gathered her men around her.  She had many friends, Gamli and
Glum, Skeggi, called Short-hand, and Ospak, who was mentioned
before.  So much beloved was she that the whole of Midfjord rose
to help her, even those who had once been Grettir's enemies. 
Chief among these was Thorodd Drapustuf, who was joined by most
of the Hrutafjord men.

Angle reached Bjarg with a following of twenty men, bringing
Grettir's head with him.  All those who had promised their
support had not yet come in.  Angle's party entered the room with
the head and set it on the floor.  The mistress of the house was
there and several others; no greeting passed between them.  Angle
spoke a verse:

     "Grettir's head I bring thee here.
     Weep for the red-haired hero, lady.
     On the floor it lies; 'twere rotten by this,
     but I laid it in salt.  Great glory is mine."

She sat silent while he spoke his verse; then she said:

     "The swine would have fled like sheep from the fox
     if Grettir had stood there hearty and strong.
     Shame on the deeds that were done in the North!
     Little the glory you gain from my lay."

Many said it was small wonder that she had brave sons, so brave
was she herself before the insults which she had received.  Ospak
was outside and was talking with those of Angle's men who had not
gone in.  He asked about the fray, and they all praised Illugi
for the defence that he had made.  They also told of Grettir's
firm grip on his sword after he was dead, and the men thought it
marvellous.  Then a number of men were seen riding from the West;
they were the friends of Asdis with Gamli and Skeggi, who had
come from Melar.

Angle had intended to have an execution against Illugi and to
claim all his property, but when all these men came up he saw
that it would not do.  Ospak and Gamli were very forward in
wanting to fight with Angle, but the wiser heads told them to get
the advice of their kinsmen Thorvald and other chiefs, and said
that the more men of knowledge occupied themselves with the
affair the worse it would be for Angle.  Through their
intervention Angle got away and took with him Grettir's head,
which he intended to produce at the All-Thing.  He rode home
thinking that matters were going badly for him, for nearly all
the chiefs in the land were either relations or connections of
Grettir and Illugi.

That summer Skeggi Short-hand married the daughter of Thorodd
Drapustuf, who then took part in the case on the side of
Grettir's kinsmen.


CHAPTER LXXXIV

THORBJORN IS EXILED AT THE THING

Men now rode to the Thing.  Angle's party was smaller than he had
expected, because the matter had come to be badly spoken of. 
Halldor asked whether they were to take Grettir's head with them
to the All-Thing.  Angle said he meant to take it.

"That is an ill-advised thing to do," said Halldor; "there are
quite enough men against you as it is, without your doing such a
thing as that to re-awaken their grief."

They were then on the road, and meant to ride South by Sand, so
Angle let him take the head and bury it in a sand-hill, which is
now called Grettisthuf.

The Thing was very full.  Angle brought forward his case, making
the most of his own deeds.  He told them how he had killed the
forest-man on whose head the highest price had been laid, and he
claimed the money.  Thorir replied as before.  Then the Lawman
was asked for his opinion.  He said that he wished to hear
whether any counter-charge was made, by which Angle should
forfeit the outlaw money; if not, the money offered for Grettir's
head must be paid.  Then Thorvald the son of Asgeir asked Short-
hand to bring the case before the court, and he declared a first
summons against Thorbjorn Angle for witchcraft and sorcery
through which Grettir had met with his death, and a second for
having killed a man who was half dead, crimes which he said were
punishable with outlawry.

There was a great division of parties, but those who supported
Thorbjorn were few.  It went very unexpectedly for him, for
Thorvald and his son-in-law Isleif held that to do a man to death
by sorcery was a crime worthy of death.  Finally, by the counsel
of wise men sentence was passed that Thorbjorn was to leave
Iceland that summer and not to return during the lifetime of any
of the men concerned in the case on the side of Illugi and
Grettir.  It was enacted as a law that all sorcerers should be
outlawed.

When Thorbjorn saw what his fate was going to be he got away from
the Thing, for Grettir's friends were making preparations to
attack him.  None of the money that was set upon Grettir's head
did he get; Steinn the Lawman would not allow it because of his
dishonourable conduct; nor was any bloodmoney paid for the men
who had fallen on his side in Drangey; they were set off against
Illugi, an arrangement, however, with which Illugi's kinsmen were
not at all pleased.

Men rode home from the Thing, and all the feuds which had arisen
on Grettir's account were now at an end.  Skeggi the son of
Gamli, son-in-law of Thorodd Drapustuf and sister's son of
Grettir, went North to Skagafjord with the assistance of Thorvald
Asgeirsson and of his son-in-law Isleif, who afterwards became
bishop of Skalaholt.  After obtaining the consent of the whole
community he took ship and went to Drangey, where he found the
bodies of Grettir and Illugi and brought them to Reykir in
Reykjastrand and buried them in the church.  Testimony of Grettir
lying there is in the fact that in the days of the Sturlungs,
when the church at Reykir was moved to another place, Grettir's
bones were dug up, and were found to be enormously big and
strong.  Illugi was buried later on the north side of the church,
and Grettir's head was buried in the church at his home in Bjarg.

Asdis remained in Bjarg and was so beloved that no one molested
her any more than they did while Grettir was an outlaw.  The
property at Bjarg passed after her death to Skeggi Short-hand,
who became a great man.  His son was Gamli, the father of Skeggi
of Skarfsstad and of Alfdis the mother of Odd the Monk, from whom
many are descended.


CHAPTER LXXXV

THORBJORN GOES TO NORWAY AND CONSTANTINOPLE

Thorbjorn Angle embarked at Gasar with as much of his own
property as he was able to get.  His lands went to his brother
Hjalti, including Drangey, which Angle gave him.  Hjalti became a
great chief later on, but is not mentioned again in our story.

Angle went to Norway and still made himself very important.  He
was supposed to have done a great deed of valour in slaying
Grettir, and many who did not know how it really happened
honoured him accordingly; but there were some to whom Grettir's
fame was known.  He only told so much of the story as tended to
his own glory, but whatever was less creditable to him he
omitted.  In the autumn his account reached Tunsberg and came to
the ears of Thorsteinn Dromund, who kept very quiet, for he had
been told that Angle was a very doughty man and valiant.  He
remembered the talk which he had had with Grettir in days long
past about his arms, and obtained news of Angle's movements. 
They were both in Norway that winter, but Thorbjorn was in the
North and Thorsteinn in Tunsberg, so that they did not see each
other.  Angle knew, however, that Grettir had a brother in
Norway, and did not feel very secure in a strange country; so he
asked advice as to what he had better do.  In those days many of
the Norsemen used to go to Mikligard (1) to take service. 
Thorbjorn thought it would suit him very well to go there and
earn wealth and glory instead of staying in the northern parts
where there were relations of Grettir.  So he made ready to leave
Norway, embarked, and did not stop until he reached
Constantinople, and obtained service there.

CHAPTER LXXXVI

GRETTIR'S DEATH AVENGED BY HIS BROTHER THORSTEINN DROMUND

Thorsteinn Dromund was a wealthy man and highly thought of.  On
hearing of Angle's departure to Constantinople he handed over his
property to his kinsmen and followed him, dogging his movements
as he went, without Angle knowing.  He reached Constantinople
very soon after Angle, intending at all costs to kill him. 
Neither knew of the other.

Both wanted to be received into the Varangian Guards, and their
offer was well received directly it was known that they were
Norsemen.  At that time Michael Catalactus was king over
Constantinople.  Thorsteinn Dromund watched for an opportunity of
meeting Angle where he might recognise him, but failed amidst the
crowd, so he kept on the watch, caring little for his own well-
being and ever thinking how much he had lost.

The next thing that happened was that the Varangians were ordered
on field service for the defence of the country.  The custom and
the law were that before they marched a review was held for the
inspection of their weapons; this was done on the present
occasion.  On the day appointed for the review all the Varangians
and all who were marching with them had to appear and show their
arms.  Thorsteinn and Angle both presented themselves.  Thorbjorn
was the first to show his weapons and he presented the sword
Grettisnaut.  As he showed it all marvelled and declared that it
was indeed a noble weapon, but said it was a bad fault that a
piece was out of the middle of the edge, and they asked how that
had come about.  Angle said that was a tale worth telling.

"The first thing I must tell you," he said, "is that out in
Iceland I slew a hero named Grettir the Strong.  He was a
tremendous warrior and so valorous that no one could succeed in
killing him until I came.  But as I was destined to be his
slayer, I overcame him, although he was many times stronger than
I am.  I cut off his head with this sword and broke a piece out
of the edge."

Those who stood by said he must have had a hard skull, and they
showed the sword round.  From this Thorsteinn came to know which
was Angle, and asked to be shown the sword with the others. 
Angle willingly showed it to him, for they were all praising his
strength and courage, and he, having no notion of its being
Thorsteinn or any relation of Grettir, thought he would do
likewise.  Dromund took the sword, at once raised it aloft and
struck a blow at Angle.  It came into his head with such force
that it penetrated to his jaw and Thorbjorn fell dead to the
ground.  Thereupon all the men became silent.  The officer of the
place put Thorsteinn under arrest and asked him why he had
committed such a breach of discipline in the sanctity of the
Assembly.  Thorsteinn said he was a brother of Grettir the Strong
and that he had never been able to obtain his vengeance till that
moment.  Then many of them stood up for him and said there was
much excuse for a man who had come such a long way to avenge his
brother.  The elders of the town thought that this might be true,
but as there was no one present to bear out his word they fell
back upon their own law, which declared that any man who slew
another should lose nothing else than his life.

Judgment was quickly passed upon Thorsteinn, and it was rather
hard.  He was to sit in a dark chamber in a dungeon and there
await his death unless some one came to pay a ransom for him. 
When he reached the dungeon he found a man who had been there a
long time and was all but dead from misery.  It was both foul and
cold.  Thorsteinn asked him: "How do you find your life?"

"Most evil," he replied; "no one will help me, for I have no
kinsmen to pay a ransom."

"There are many ways out of a difficulty," said Thorsteinn, "let
us be happy and do something to cheer ourselves."

The man said he had no joy in anything.

"We will try it," said Thorsteinn.

Then he began to sing songs.  He was such a singer that it would
be hard to find his like, and he spared nothing.  The dungeon was
close to the public road and Thorsteinn sang so loud that it
resounded from the walls; the man who before was half dead had
much joy therefrom.  In this way he sang every evening.


CHAPTER LXXXVII

THE LADY SPES

There was a very distinguished lady in that town, the owner of a
large establishment, very rich and highly born.  Her name was
Spes.  Her husband's name was Sigurd; he too was wealthy, but of
lower birth than she was.  She had been married to him for his
money.  There was not much love between them, and the marriage
was thought an unhappy one.  She was very proud, and had much
dignity.

One evening when Thorsteinn was diverting himself she happened to
pass along the street near the dungeon and heard singing so sweet
that she declared she had never heard the like.  She was walking
with several retainers, and told them to go in and find out who
it was that had such a magnificent voice.  They called out and
asked who was there in such close confinement.  Thorsteinn told
his name.  Spes said:

"Are you as good at other things as you are at singing?"

He said there was not much in that.

"What have you done," she asked, "that they should torture you
here to death?"

He said he had killed a man and avenged his brother; "but I have
no witness to prove it," he said; "so I have been put here unless
some one comes to release me, of which there seems little hope,
since I have no relations here."

"A great loss would it be if you were killed," she said.  "Was
your brother then a man of such renown, he whom you avenged?"

Thorsteinn said he was half as good a man again as himself.

She asked what token there was of that.  Then Thorsteinn spoke
this verse:

     "Goddess of rings!  No eight could meet him,
     or gain the sword from his vanquished hand.
     Brave was Grettir; his foemen doughty
     severed the hand of the ruler of ships."

Those who understood the song declared that it told of great
nobility.  When she heard that she asked:

"Will you receive your life at my hands if the choice is offered
you?"

"Indeed I will," he said, "if this companion of mine sitting here
is released along with me.  If not, we must both remain sitting
here together."

She answered: "I think you are more worth paying for than he is."

"However that may be," he said, "either we both of us come out
from here together or neither of us comes out."

So she went to the Varangians' quarters and asked for the release
of Thorsteinn, offering money.  They agreed.  With her interest
and her wealth she brought it about that both of them were
released.  Directly Thorsteinn came out of the dungeon he went to
pay his respects to the lady Spes.  She welcomed him and kept him
there secretly.  From time to time he went campaigning with the
Varangians, and was distinguished for his courage in all their
engagements.


CHAPTER LXXXVIII

ADVENTURES OF THORSTEINN AND SPES

At that time Harald the son of Sigurd (1) was in Constantinople,
and Thorsteinn became friendly with him.  Thorsteinn was now a
very great personage, for Spes kept him well supplied with money,
and they became very much attached to one another.  She was a
great admirer of his skill.  Her expenses were very great because
she tried to keep up many friends.  Her husband noticed a great
change in her character and her behaviour, and especially that
she had become very extravagant.  Treasures of gold and other
property which were in her keeping disappeared.  One day her
husband Sigurd spoke with her and said that he was much surprised
at her conduct.  "You pay no attention to our affairs," he said,
"and squander money in many ways.  You seem as if you were in a
dream, and never wish to be where I am.  I am certain that
something is going on."

She replied: "I told you as I told my kinsmen when we married
that I meant to be my own mistress in all matters which concern
myself; that is why I do not spare your money.  Or is there
anything more than this that you wish to speak about with me?  Do
you accuse me of anything shameful?"

He said : "I am not without my suspicions that you are keeping
some man whom you prefer to me."

"I do not know," she said, "that there would be very much in
that; and yet of a surety there is no truth in what you say.  I
will not speak with you alone if you bring such improper
accusations against me."

He dropped the subject for the time.  She and Thorsteinn
continued to carry on as before, and were not very heedful of the
talk of evil-minded people; they relied upon her wits and her
popularity.  They were often sitting together and diverting
themselves.

One evening when they were sitting in an upper room in which her
treasures were kept she asked Thorsteinn to sing something, and
thinking that her husband was as usual sitting at drink she
fastened the door.  When he had sung for a time there was a
banging at the door, and some one called to them to open it.  It
was her husband with a number of his followers.  The lady had
opened a large chest to show Thorsteinn the treasures.  When she
knew who was outside she refused to open the door, and said to
Thorsteinn: "Quickly! Jump into the chest and keep very quiet."

He did so.  She locked the chest and sat upon it.  Her husband
then entered, having forced his way in.  She said:

"What are you coming here for with all this uproar?  Are there
robbers after you?"

He said: "Now it is well that you yourself give proof of what you
are.  Where is the man who was letting his voice run on so
grandly?  No doubt you think his voice is better than mine."

"No man is a fool if he keeps silence," she said; "that applies
to you.  You think yourself very cunning, and would like to
fasten your lies on to me, as in this case.  Well, if you have
spoken the truth, find the man.  He will not escape through the
walls or the roof."

He searched all through the room and found nothing.

"Why don't you take him," she said, "if you are so certain?"

He was silent and knew not how he could have been deceived.  He
asked his men whether they had not heard what he heard, but when
they saw that the lady was displeased there was nothing to be got
out of them; they said that one was often mistaken about sounds. 
He then went away, not doubting that he knew the truth, though he
could not find the man.  After that he ceased for some time to
pry into his wife's concerns.

On another occasion, much later, Thorsteinn and Spes were sitting
in a tiring-room where dresses were kept which belonged to them,
both made up and in the piece.  She showed many of the cloths to
Thorsteinn and spread them out.  When they were least expecting
it her husband came up with a troop of men and broke into the
room.  While they were forcing their way in she covered
Thorsteinn up with a bundle of clothes and leaned against the
heap when they entered.

"Do you again deny," he said, "that there was a man here with
you?  There are those present here now who saw you both."

She told him not to be so violent.  "You will not fail to catch
him now," she said.  "Only leave me in peace and do not push me
about."

They searched the room, but finding nothing had to give it up.

"It is always good to have better proofs than people suppose.  It
was only to be expected that you would not find what was not
there.  Now, my husband, will you admit your folly and free me
from this slanderous accusation?"

"By no means will I free you," he said, "for I know that what I
have accused you of is true, and it will cost you an effort to
free yourself of the charge."

She said she was quite ready to do that, and there. with they
parted.

After this Thorsteinn remained entirely with the Varangians.  Men
say that he acted by the advice of Harald the son of Sigurd, and
it is thought that they would not have got out of it as they did
if they had not made use of him and his wits.

After a time Sigurd gave out that he was about to go abroad on
some business.  His wife did not try to dissuade him.  When he
was gone Thorsteinn came to Spes and they were always together. 
Her house was built on the very edge of the sea and there were
some of the rooms under which the sea flowed.

Here it was that Spes and Thorsteinn always sat.  There was a
small trap-door in the floor, known to no one but these two, and
it was kept open in case of its being wanted in a hurry.

Sigurd, it must be told, did not go away, but concealed himself
so as to be able to watch his wife's doings.  One evening when
they were sitting unconcernedly in the room over the sea and
enjoying themselves, in came her husband with a party of men,
taking them by surprise.  He had taken some of the men to the
window of the room that they might see whether it was not as he
had said.  They all said that he had spoken truly, and that it
must have been so too on the former occasions.  Then they rushed
into the room.

On hearing the noise Spes said to Thorsteinn: "You must go down
here whatever it costs.  Give me some sign that you have got away
from the house."

He promised that he would, and descended through the floor.  The
lady closed the trap-door with her foot, and it fell back into
its place so that no one could see any mark of the floor having
been touched.  Sigurd entered the room with his men, searched,
and of course found nothing.  The room was uninhabited and there
was no furniture in it, but only the bare floor and a bed, on
which the lady was sitting and twirling her fingers.  She paid
little attention to them and seemed as if their business did not
concern her.  Sigurd thought it altogether ridiculous and asked
his followers if they had not seen the man.  They declared that
they had seen him most assuredly.

The lady said: "Now we may say as the proverb has it: A11 good
things are in threes.  This is your case, Sigurd.  Three times
you have disturbed me, if I remember rightly; and now are you any
the wiser than you were in the beginning?"

"This time I am not alone to tell the story," he said.  "For all
that you will have to clear yourself, for on no terms will I
allow your shameful deeds to go unpunished."

"It seems," she said, "that you require the very thing which I
would myself propose.  It will please me well to show the
falsehood of this accusation, which has been so thoroughly aired
that I shall be disgraced if I cannot refute it."

"At the same time," he said, "you will have to deny that you have
expended my money and my property."

She replied: "At the time when I clear myself I will refute all
the matters which you brought against me, and you may consider
how it will all end.  I mean to go at once, to-morrow morning,
before the bishop that he may grant me full compurgation from
this charge."

Her husband was satisfied with this and went away with his men.

In the meantime Thorsteinn had swum away from the house and
landed at a convenient place, where he got a firebrand and held
it aloft so that it could be seen from the lady's house.  She
stayed long outside in the evening and the night, for she was
anxious to know whether Thorsteinn had reached the land.  When
she saw the light she knew that he had landed, for that was the
signal which they had agreed upon.

The next morning Spes proposed to her husband that they should
speak with the bishop on their matter.  This he was quite ready
to do, so they went before the bishop and Sigurd repeated his
accusation.  The bishop asked whether she had ever been accused
of misbehaviour before, but nobody had heard of such a thing. 
Then he asked upon what evidence this charge was brought against
her, and Sigurd produced the men who had seen her sitting in a
room with the door locked and a man with her.  Her husband said
that this was ground enough for supposing that the man meant to
seduce her.

The bishop said that she might very well purge herself from this
accusation if she so desired.  She replied that she desired it
very much.  "I hope," she said, "that I shall have many women to
swear for me on this charge."

The form of the oath which she was to swear was then communicated
to her and the day for the compurgation fixed.  She returned home
and was quite happy.  She and Thorsteinn met and laid their
plans.

CHAPTER LXXXIX

THE ORDEAL

The day now arrived when Spes was to make oath.  She invited all
her friends and relations, and appeared in the finest clothes
that she possessed, with many a fine lady in her train.  It was
raining heavily and the roads were flooded; on the way to the
church there was a swamp to be passed.  When Spes came with her
company to the swamp there was a great crowd on the high road,
and a multitude of poor people asking for alms, for all who knew
her thought it a duty to give her a greeting and wish her well
because of the kindnesses which they had often received from her.

Amongst these poor people there was a beggar very large of
stature and with a long beard.  The women halted at the swamp;
being people of high rank they did not like to cross the dirty
slough.  The big beggar, seeing that Spes was better dressed than
the other ladies, said to her: "Good lady, have the condescension
to allow me to carry you over the swamp.  It is the duty of us
gaberlunzies to serve you in whatever way we can."

"How can you carry me," she said, "when you can scarcely carry
yourself?"

"Nevertheless, it would be a great condescension.  I cannot offer
you more than I have, and you will prosper the better in other
things for having had no pride with a poor man."

"Know then for a surety," she said, "that if you carry me not
properly the skin shall be flayed from your back."

"Gladly will I venture upon that," he said, and waded out into
the stream.  She pretended to dislike very much being carried by
him; nevertheless, she got upon his back.  He staggered along
very slowly, using two crutches, and when they reached the middle
he was reeling in every direction.  She told him to pull himself
together.  "If you drop me here," she said, "it shall be the
worst journey that you ever made."

The poor wretch gathered up all his strength and still went on. 
By dint of a valiant effort he had all but reached the shore when
he struck his foot against something and fell forwards,
projecting her on to the bank while he himself fell into the mire
up to his armpits.  There as he lay he put out his hands, not on
her clothes, but on her legs.  She sprang up cursing and said she
always suffered ill from low vagabonds.  "It would only be right
that you should have a good beating," she said, "were I not
ashamed to beat such a miserable creature as you are."

He said: "Unequal is the lot of man.  I thought to earn some
benefit and to receive alms from you, and you only give me abuse
and insult without any reward."  And he pretended to be very much
disgusted.  Many felt pity for him, but she said he was a very
cunning rascal.  When they all began to beg for him she took out
her purse, wherein was many a golden penny.  She shook out the
money, saying: "Take that, fellow!  It would not be right that
you should go unpaid for all my scoldings.  You are now paid for
what you have done."

He gathered up the money and thanked her for her liberality. 
Spes then went to the church, which was full of people.  Sigurd
proceeded with energy and told her to clear herself of the charge
which he had brought against her.

"I pay no heed to your accusation," she said; "but I want to know
what man it was whom you pretend to have seen in the room with
me, because there is always some proper man near me; there is
nothing to be ashamed of in that.  But this I will swear, that to
no man have I given money and that by no man has my body been
defiled excepting by my husband and by that beggar, who put his
muddy hands upon my leg to-day when I was carried over the
ditch."

Many then were satisfied and declared that her oath was perfectly
good and that she was in no way disgraced by a man having touched
her unwittingly.  She said she had to tell the story just as it
happened, and then she swore the oath in the words appointed for
her.  Many said that she would be observing the saying that:
Nothing should be omitted from an oath.  But she replied that
wise men would hold that there was no cause for suspicion.  Then
her relations began to talk with her and said that it was a great
insult to a woman of high birth that such lies should be told
about her and go unpunished, for they said it was an offence
punishable with death if a woman were proved to have been
unfaithful to her husband.  So Spes asked the bishop to divorce
her from Sigurd, saying that she would not endure the lies which
he had told.  Her kinsmen supported her, and with their help her
request was granted.  Sigurd got little of the property and had
to leave the country.  So it happened as usual that the weaker
had to bow, nor could he accomplish anything although the right
was on his side.  Spes took all the money and was held in high
esteem, but when men came to consider her oath they thought it
was not altogether above suspicion, and they concluded that very
skilful men had composed the Latin formula for her.  They
ferreted out that the beggar who carried her was Thorsteinn
Dromund.  But Sigurd got no redress.

THORSTEINN AND SPES RETURN TO NORWAY

While the affair was being talked about Thorsteinn Dromund
remained with the Varangians, where he was held in such high
estimation that his prowess was considered to be beyond that of
nearly every man who had come to them.  Especially Harald the son
of Sigurd did him honour, and claimed kinship with him; it was
supposed to have been by his advice that Thorsteinn had acted.

Soon after Sigurd was driven from the country Thorsteinn proposed
marriage to Spes; she was quite agreeable, but referred it to her
kinsmen.  There were family meetings and all agreed that she
herself ought to decide.  Matters were settled between them;
their union was most prosperous and they had plenty of money. 
Thorsteinn was considered lucky to have got out of his
difficulties in such a way.  After they had lived together for
two years in Constantinople, Thorsteinn told her that he would
like to visit his property once more in Norway.  She said he
should do as he pleased, and he then sold his property so as to
have some ready money.  They left the country with a good company
of followers and sailed all the way to Norway.  Thorsteinn's
kinsmen welcomed them both, and soon saw that Spes was both
generous and noble; accordingly she quickly became very popular. 
They had three children, and remained on their property very well
contented with their condition.

The king of Norway was at that time Magnus the Good.  Thorsteinn
soon went to meet him, and was well received because of the fame
which he had earned through having avenged Grettir the Strong. 
Scarcely an example was known of a man from Iceland having been
avenged in Constantinople, excepting Grettir the son of Asmund. 
It is said that Thorsteinn entered his bodyguard.  Thorsteinn
remained nine years in Norway, both he and his wife being in high
honour.  After that King Harald the son of Sigurd returned from
Constantinople, and King Magnus gave him the half of Norway. 
Both kings were together in Norway for a time.  After Magnus's
death some who had been his friends were less contented, for he
was beloved of all, but Harald was not easy to get on with, since
he was hard and severe.  Thorsteinn Dromund then began to grow
old, but was still very vigorous.  Sixteen winters had now passed
since the death of Grettir.


CHAPTER XCI

ABSOLUTION IN ROME

There were many who urged Thorsteinn to visit King Harald and
become his man, but he would not.  Spes said to him: "I would
not, Thorsteinn, that you go to Harald, for a larger debt remains
unpaid to another King, whereto we must now turn our thoughts. 
Our youth is now passed; we are both becoming old, and we have
lived more after our desires than after Christian doctrine or
regard for righteousness.  Now I know that neither kinsmen nor
wealth may pay this debt if we pay it not ourselves.  I would
therefore that we now change our way of life and leave the
country to betake ourselves to Pafagard.(1)  I have hope that so
I shall be absolved from my sin."

Thorsteinn answered: "The matter of which you speak is as well
known to me as it is to you.  It is right that you should rule
now, and most seemly, since you allowed me to rule when our
matter was much less hopeful.  And so shall it be now in all that
you say."

This resolve of theirs took men by surprise.  Thorsteinn was then
two years past of sixty-five, but still vigorous in all that he
undertook.  He summoned all his kinsmen and connections to him
and told them his plans.  The wiser men approved of his resolve,
while holding his departure a great misfortune for themselves. 
Thorsteinn said there was no certainty of his return.  He said:

"I wish now to thank you all for the care of my goods which you
took while I was absent.  Now I ask you to take over my children
along with my property, and to bring them up in your own ways;
for I am now come to such an age that even if I live there is
much doubt about whether I shall return.  Manage all that I leave
behind as if I should never return to Norway."

The men answered that matters would be more easily managed if his
wife remained to look after them.

She answered: "I left my own country and came from Mikligard with
Thorsteinn, I bade farewell to my kinsmen and my possessions,
because I wished that one fate should befall us both.  And now it
has seemed pleasant to me here, but no desire have I to remain in
Norway or in these Northern lands after he has departed.  There
has always been goodwill between us and no dissension.  Now we
must both depart together; for we ourselves know best about many
things which have happened since we first met."

When they had thus dealt with their own condition, Tborsteinn
appointed certain impartial men to divide his property in two
parts.  Tborsteinn's kinsmen took over the half which was to go
to the children, and brought them up with their father's
relations.  They became in time men of the utmost valour, and
a large posterity in the Vik is sprung from them.  Thorsteinn and
Spes divided their share, giving some to the church for the good
of their souls and keeping some for themselves.  So they set off
for Rome, bearing the good wishes of many with them.

CHAPTER XCII

THE END OF THORSTEINN AND SPES

They travelled then the whole way to Rome, and appeared before
him who was appointed to hear confessions.  They related truly
all that had happened, all the cunning tricks wherewith they had
achieved their union.  They submitted with humility to the
penances laid upon them, and by reason of their having
voluntarily turned their hearts to desire absolution from their
sins, without any pressure from the elders of the church, their
penance was lightened so far as it was possible, and they were
gently admonished to arrange their lives with wisdom for the
well-being of their souls, and, after receiving absolution in
full, to live henceforward in purity.  They were declared to have
acted wisely and well.

Then the lady Spes said: "Now, I think it has gone well; and now
we have not suffered only misfortune together.  It may be that
foolish men will follow the example of our former lives.  Let us
now end in such way that we may be an example to the good.  We
will come to an agreement with some men skilled in building to
erect for each of us a stone retreat, thus may we atone for all
the offences which we have committed against God."

So Thorsteinn advanced money to stone-masons and such other
persons as might be needed, that they might not be without the
means of subsistence.  When these works were completed and all
matters were settled, a fitting time was chosen for them to part
company with each other, each to live alone, in order more surely
to partake of the eternal life in another world.  They remained
each in their own retreat, living as long as it pleased God to
spare them, and thus ending their lives.

Most men consider Thorsteinn Dromund and Spes to have been most
fortunate in escaping from the difficulties which they had fallen
into.  None of their children or posterity are mentioned as
having come to Iceland.


CHAPTER XCIII

THE TESTIMONY OF STURLA THE LAWMAN

Sturla the Lawman has declared that no outlaw was ever so
distinguished as Grettir the Strong.  For this he assigns three
reasons.  First, that he was the cleverest, inasmuch as he was
the longest time an outlaw of any man without ever being
captured, so long as he was sound in health.  Secondly, that he
was the strongest man in the land of his age, and better able
than any other to deal with spectres and goblins.  Thirdly, that
his death was avenged in Constantinople, a thing which had never
happened to any other Icelander.

Further, he says that Thorsteinn Dromund was a man who had great
luck in the latter part of his life.

Here endeth the story of Grettir the son of Asmund.
